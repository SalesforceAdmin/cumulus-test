<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Dear&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">My name is&nbsp;{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}, an Enrollment Manager here at MBO Partners. I&nbsp;understand that you are working with MBO’s Vendor Advisory Services Team to get set up as a vendor for your contract with Hewlett-Packard. In the meantime, I wanted to familiarize you with some additional HP requirements and important program characteristics.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Get to Know Your Engagement Service</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">HP has selected MBO Partners to be your engagement services provider. That means you will work “through” MBO as you complete your HP assignment. If you meet the HP requirements for a vendor relationship, you will engage through our <b>MBO Sub</b> subcontractor service. When you enroll in MBO Sub, we serve as your “agent-of-record” while you work and provide the support and white-glove service befitting a true independent professional.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Welcome_to_MBO_Sub.pdf">MBO Sub</a> makes it easy for self-employed professionals and their clients to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work. We bill HP on your behalf, collect your billings, and deposit your funds into your private online Business Center.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Background and Drug Screening</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">You will soon receive an email from Sterling Infosystems, HP’s screening vendor, with instructions for completing required background and drug screenings. (You may wish to add sterlinginfosystems.com to your email system’s safe senders list.) The screenings’ cost, about $77, will be reflected in your MBO account after enrollment. Please complete the screenings quickly so you can begin your project as soon as possible. &nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">There is a program fee associated with your HP engagement. For qualified sub-contractors, MBO will collect a program fee (2.5% of your billings) as you work.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Payment Terms</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As per contractual payment terms, HP pays MBO on Net 45 day payment terms. However, HP does not start these terms until after a month-long “Invoice Period” which ends on the 15th of each month. Based on these terms and structure, and accommodating for payment processing, you will receive your funds in as few as 55 or as many as 90 days. (Assumes HP pays MBO within its payment terms.)&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>What Comes Next?</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">There are just a few more steps before you can begin your assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">1.&nbsp;<i>Freelancer Agreement</i>. HP requires all freelancers to complete this <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/HP_Freelancer_Agreement.pdf">Freelancer Agreement</a>. Please sign it and scan/email it to me or fax it to 703-793-6463.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">2.&nbsp;<i>Documentation</i>. If you haven’t already, submit your supporting documents as instructed in the message from the MBO Vendor Advisory Services Team.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">3.&nbsp;<i>Screening</i>. As introduced above, please complete your screening requirements as soon as possible.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">4.&nbsp;<i>Enrollment</i>. After we determine your qualification status and you complete the screening requirements, you will receive another email from MBO that includes a link to our online enrollment system and some HP-required on-boarding documents for you to review and complete. If you qualify to engage as a vendor, the enrollment system will prompt you to sign a Contractor Agreement. (Here’s a sample <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Contractor_Agreement_MBO_Sub_Sample.pdf">Contractor Agreement</a>.)</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">5.&nbsp;<i>Begin!</i> Once you’ve enrolled, I’ll activate your MBO account and provide detailed instructions for entering your time and expenses.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">If you have any questions about these items, please contact me at the number below. If you have questions about the vendor qualification process, please address them with your Vendor Advisory Services Team representative.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Once again, we look forward to making your contract assignment with HP a positive and enjoyable experience.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Sincerely,</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}</font></div><div><font face="arial">Enrollment Manager</font></div><div><font face="arial">MBO Partners</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div>]]></td>
