Subject: RE: MBO Partners Call Follow Up Hi Randall, Sounds good. Most companies want to use their own contract so I am used to that. I think the disability is pretty good if it were me, I would do it.

Subject: Re: MBO Partners Call Follow Up Sara - the client said they need to use their contract as it is an internal requirement.  They should have something by beginning of next week.    Do you think I should sign up for the disability option?   From: Sara Conde &lt; &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sconde@mbopartners.com&lt;span style=&apos;mso-bookmark:_MailOriginal&gt;&gt;
