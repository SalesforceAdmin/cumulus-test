When you refer a friend, every referral you submit gives you a chance to win a home office makeover worth up to $5,000! You will also be giving your friend the opportunity to try us for free. Finally, if your friend likes what we do, we will deposit $500 into your Business Center upon their enrollment and subsequent client collected billings of $30,000.

CEO CORNER
Enjoy the Holidays without Losing your Contracts

As the conversations in your neighborhood turn to mistletoe and eggnog, you’ll inevitably hear people comparing vacation time. Some companies are generous, and some can be Scrooge-like.



However, as an independent, no one tells you when to vacation; you just have to figure it out. Your clients will be thinking about their own holiday stressors— they all have in-laws coming to town, too. However, they’ll still be expecting their deliverables when they return (contract documents aren’t known to celebrate any major holidays).  More&gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/CEOCornerDecember2012.html&gt;
BOOK REVIEW
Amy O&apos;Donnell, VP Talent Management, Critiques &quot;Drive&quot;

I am always intrigued by the subject of motivation and what internally inspires us to achieve success.  So when I came across Dan Pink’s latest book &quot; Drive, The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,&quot; I decided to pick up a copy to catch up on the latest research.



The main premise is that today’s organizations have it all wrong when it comes to what motivates us. Most businesses operate under the belief that the key to motivation is providing tangible rewards, such as a cash bonus or a corner office. More &gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/BookReviewAmyODonnellDec2012.html&gt;
