There would be no law to reference because the employer (MBO) can choose who they deem to be an authorized representative for them.  Since you are a remote hire, we are asking a notary to act as the authorized representative for MBO because we deem them as a &quot;person of trust&quot; it is completely up to them whether they choose to act in this capacity for us. When they sign and date the document they can sign as a authorized representative (if they prefer) for their title and there is no need for any kind of notary stamp.   We are not asking them to notarize the form (which does go against CA notary law.) Understandably (and unfortunately) a lot of confusion occurs when we ask a notary to sign and date a form as an authorized representative because they have the position of trust that a notary carries (but not to notarize the document or act in an official notary capacity on the document.)  Its like asking an office notary to sign for a package (because you trust them) but not to notarize the document stating they received the package.  We have a list of notarys that we work with in CA, you can find that list here. &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-exec-group-benefits-2013&gt; Please let me know if you have any additional quesitons.  Thanks,Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: Consultant Agreement Hi Nicolette: If CA State law specifies that notary publics may witness signatures on I9 forms by signing and NOT using their official seal then I will have the document witnessed by a notary public immediately.   If CA State law does NOT support this, however, and one of your reps isn&apos;t w/in 10 miles or able to come to me, then we are going to have another problem for which we should start thinking of alternative ways to handle. Who else do you trust?  My landlord?  One of the reps from my Credit Union?  The owner of local business? Best,
Nita

Subject: RE: Consultant Agreement Hi Nita, I am trying to get ahold of something official from the state of CA and will forward it to you as soon as I get something back from my HR department.   We actually have employees of MBO that are in CA that can sign as the authorized representative if you do not feel comfortable going back to a notary to have them sign in the interim.   I do want to clarify what MBO is asking the notary to do. Section 2 of the I-9 form is for the employer or &quot;authorized representative&quot; of the employer to sign in the case of a remote hire (such as yours.) Because you are a remote hire, we are asking a notary to act as the authorized representative for MBO because we deem them as a &quot;person of trust&quot; it is completely up to them whether they choose to act in this capacity for us. I will get back to you with any specific laws if we have them, but if there is not specifically anything that I can find, I will ask one of our resources that we have employed that is nearby to you to help take care of this for you. Thank you and have a great weekend!Nicolette   From: Nita Miller [mailto:nita@millerpatent.com &lt;mailto:nita@millerpatent.com&gt;]

Subject: Re: Consultant Agreement Hi Nicolette: If you provide me with sufficient legal evidence of the following CA State Law I will take care of it: CA Notaries are not allowed to NOTARIZE I9 forms but can sign as authorized reps, witnessing your signature.   Best,

Subject: RE: Consultant Agreement Hi Nita, I actually need you to take the I9 to a notary and have them sign as an authorized representative, using the I9 that populates in our system when you electronically signed the benefits summary during your enrollment.  You can access this document by logging into the MBO system and then clicking on Click to access ENROLLMENT DOCUMENTS (Enrollment Documents is a hyperlink) and page 13 is the I9 form (page 12 is an example page to show how it should be filled out).  Per the issue you have run into, sometimes it can be tricky in CA to get a notary to sign this document, if you get push back you can let them know that they do not have to stamp, but just sign and put their title as authorized representative (CA Notaries are not allowed to NOTARIZE I9 forms but can sign as authorized reps, witnessing your signature).  We deem a notary a person of trust to witness your signature on our behalf since we are not physically located where you are.  We have a few pre-identified notaries in CA that will sign the document for you, so I will look in our system to see if one is located close to you.  You can also follow this link:  http://www.notaryrotary.com/ &lt;http://www.notaryrotary.com/&gt; and type in your zip code and call notaries that will meet you to take care of this.   They are not certifying that you are authorized to work in the US, they are signing that they checked your identifications and witnessed your signature in lieu of your actual employer being present and that to the best of their knowledge are authorized to work.  I know this is a pain point that we have always experienced because of CA laws, but I know for a fact that they are allowed to sign as an authorized rep without stamping the document with their notary seal and that is what we are looking for.  They also do not need to put the date your employment began.   Please let me know if you have any additional questions about this or would like me to refer you to one of our notaries that we have worked with in the past that will sign the document for you (also know that if they charge you a fee you can submit it as a deductible expense in our system). Thanks!Nicolette From: Nita Miller [mailto:nita@millerpatent.com &lt;mailto:nita@millerpatent.com&gt;]
