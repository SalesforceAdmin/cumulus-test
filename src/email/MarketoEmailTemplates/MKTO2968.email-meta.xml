Subject: Re: Steven&apos;s deal Hi Steve, That&apos;s no problem for us. The only think we&apos;d need is an invoice from MBO Partners for your monthly services and in the future, invoices every time we&apos;d hire you according to your day rate. We can extend you POs for those and we&apos;d be billing MBO as if it&apos;s one of our suppliers. I have CCed Elaine who will work out the logistics for this. Thnks SteveLD---------------------LUKAS DERKSEN---------------------MANAGING PARTNER NYCM: +1.718.938.4060Skype: lderksen1SIDLEE.COM &lt;http://SIDLEE.COM&gt;---------------------Sent from my iPhone
