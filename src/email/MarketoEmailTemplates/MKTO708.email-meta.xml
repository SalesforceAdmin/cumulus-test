You are very welcome.  I actually will need to forward your information over to an account manager that works specifically with Booz Allen but I will see if they are available at the same time that you scheduled the call with me.  If not I will have them reach out directly and reschedule.
 
Thank you for reaching out and have a great evening,
Nicolette

Hi, Nicolette.
 
Thank you for reaching out. I used the link to schedule a call for tomorrow at 1:00 pm.
 
As background, I am currently employed with Booz Allen, but my position will end at the end of this month. My manager let me know that they are interested in having me work in almost the same capacity as a contractor. They suggested that I work through MBO and it looks like a good solution.
 
I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.
 
Thank you,
Ruth
