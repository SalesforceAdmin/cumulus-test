We don’t see the reason for the $13.88 difference either; I have sent it to our programmers. I will let you know what I hear back. Thanks!Sara From: Michael Siegel [mailto:mikes@taricgroup.com]

Subject: RE: MBO Partners Information Hi Mike, My name is Sara Conde and I am helping Nicolette out while she is on vacation. Your Gross Pay is a function of the Employer Payroll Taxes, while the Employer Payroll Taxes are simultaneously a function of your Gross Pay. Our system is able to resolve this simultaneous equation down to the penny to find exactly the right Gross Pay so that all the taxes (and other “above the line” expenses) add up correctly.  The reason why it is appropriate for the Employer Payroll Taxes to be calculated based on the Gross Pay (rather than Gross Billings) is simply because that’s what the law says to do. All Employer Payroll Taxes (SS, Medicare, state and federal unemployment, Workers Comp, and other local employer taxes) are calculated as a percentage of Gross Pay. Part of the appeal of the MBO model is that the Employer Payroll Taxes are accounted for as business expenses and therefore work to reduce this Gross Pay amount.  Remember, as your employer, MBO is actually paying these Employer Payroll Taxes on your behalf from billings we collect from your client. In our model, your earnings are technically the Gross Pay amount, not the Gross Billings amount. The Gross Billings are what your client pays MBO for your services. We then calculate your Gross Pay based on all your expenses (including the Employer Payroll Taxes, our fee, and the other items depicted on the PDF).  I hope this helps clear things up. Thank you,SaraFrom: Nicolette Taylor

Subject: Re: MBO Partners Information Hi Mike, Unfortunately I do not have an excel version of the estimate.  All of the formulas are coded into our system, and there is no straight way to calculate the taxes that I know of.  As far as I understand the taxes are calculated based on a circular equation that calculates everything based on the gross W2 pay.  You need to take into account that federal and state unemployment cap out after a certain amount are paid in for the year as well as social security.  I would be happy to speak with you about this when I am back in the office on July 3rd.  Thank you and have a great weekend!  Nicolette
