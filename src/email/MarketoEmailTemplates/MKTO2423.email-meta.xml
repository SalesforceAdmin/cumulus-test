    <subject>MBO Partners Independent Consulting Brief - February 2013</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
I know firsthand that the number one goal for independent workers is to score a large enterprise contract. That’s because my business role requires me to oversee the enterprise level engagement for thousands of independent experts each year. Independents know goldmine enterprise contracts often come with challenges and risks. 

The structural benefits of using a third party – such as an Independent Contractor Engagement Specialist (ICES) – are critical to success in today’s new independent labor market. Knowing how to take advantage of this business structure can solve many problems current and new aspiring ICs and small firms face. Here&apos;s my take on the challenges and solutions &gt; &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/challenges-independent-workers-engaging-enterprise-organizations-and-how-overcome-them&gt;

THE CHALLENGES OF INDEPENDENT WORKERS ENGAGING WITH ENTERPRISE ORGANIZATIONS
In today’s tumultuous labor market, large organizations are in need of specified expertise more than ever – and find it smart to engage with contract talent to get work done. Organizations that can safely and easily access a pool of unique experts can react quickly to changing market demands and pressures. For many leading organizations, this agility is a significant competitive advantage. For independent experts, large enterprises can be goldmines, so it follows that the relationship of an independent contractor and an enterprise should be a marriage made in heaven, right?


Unfortunately, large organizations can be bureaucratic quicksand to a small firm trying to provide expert services, sucking up time and energy that could be using to earn revenue elsewhere. Between vendor qualification forms, approved vendor lists, purchase order authority, invoicing format requirements, contractual formalities such as indemnifications, intellectual property rights, business insurance coverage, non-disclosure agreements, background checks and drug screens, the contracting process alone at these firms can be overwhelming and discouraging, despite the clear profit and growth potential.
