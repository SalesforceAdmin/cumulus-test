I spoke with the head of my department about our conversation last week regarding the work you do and your utilization of contract workers.  He let me know that we have recently partnered with odesk which is a company that helps businesses manage employees/contract workers.  We are setting up a relationship with them where you can pay your 1099’s through them from the billings that come into the MBO business center.  I don’t have a ton of information on the program as it is a new setup but I have included a link below for you to look into some of the solutions odesk provides.  Even if you decide to not run any of your billings through MBO this may be something you want to utilize for your company in the future to help manage these individuals you pay for contract work

Please let me know if you have any additional questions about this.
 
Thanks!
Nicolette
