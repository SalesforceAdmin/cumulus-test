We are all set to go I just need Exponential to send over a SOW (I have been nagging them about it for a while.) I just sent them another reminder. If you could nudge your contact and inform them this is the only thing holding up your billing that might be helpful in expediting the process.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks again.
 
Sara

Hi Tim,
 
Thank you so much. Can you have your agent issue us a “certificate of insurance naming MBO as holder” as soon as I have this we will be all set to invoice.
 
Thanks so much for getting this to me!
Sara

Ok sounds good.

The long and the short of it is good news – you won’t need workers comp. So if you would like to purchase the GL you are good to go.
 
We will talk later.
 
Thanks!
Sara
