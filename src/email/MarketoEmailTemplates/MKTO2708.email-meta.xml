MBO Partners – Enterprise Solutions invites you to join us at the Staffing Industry Analysts conference for some fine wine, cheese and chocolate on Tuesday night immediately after the day’s activities at 6 p.m. We will be at the Eno Wine Bar in the center of the lobby on your way out to dinner or back from the event. There will be a wine tasting for aficionados as well as a beginner&apos;s class, so catch up on the latest tips and trends over a glass of wine and some tasty cheese or chocolate. 
MBO will be providing one-on-one consultations in a private and comfortable location during both SIA conferences (Sept 9 to Sept 12), from Monday at 1 p.m. until Thursday at noon. 
Use our handy appointment booker to reserve your time with MBO executives familiar with the latest rules, regulations and cases, or request to speak with Eric Rumbaugh, General Counsel. You may even want to get an advanced preview of our new Project Platform that will change the way you look at IC Engagement! If you would like to book a meeting, let me know and I will send you a link to the “Time Driver” application when the conference schedule is confirmed.
Steve
