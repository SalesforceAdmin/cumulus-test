I spoke with Ashley and she gave me some insight on the work you will be doing.  You will be working under Jim’s team center with MBO for the project you are helping him with and he is currently in the process with Ashley of getting the contract in place with the client.  SO this means all you have to do is get me the I9 form and we will wait for Ashley to execute the agreement on Jim’s behalf.  Once this happens I will work to get you activated and we can begin billing from there.
 
Have a great day and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.
 
Nicolette
