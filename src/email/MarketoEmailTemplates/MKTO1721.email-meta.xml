Subject: Re: Contract Acknowledgement Form Sara,  Okay, I finagled with Calvin Group and I think they&apos;re willing to do it without the contract as we discussed.  They still need to get approval from Irena in order to do that.  She wasn&apos;t in the office today, but the number to the Calvin Group office is (310) 287 - 2400 and her extension is 307.  Go ahead and get in touch with her directly and -PLEASE- try to make something work.   Let me know if they&apos;re on-board with that.  As for Valentine, he called me yesterday at noon advising I take the rail out to Pasadena.I&apos;ve never heard of a notary that didn&apos;t travel, and I&apos;m not taking the two-hour ride each direction to make that happen, so I&apos;ll look for an alternative.         -Max  On Wed, Jul 11, 2012 at 12:49 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:&gt; Just in case…&gt; &gt; http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Contract_Acknowledgement &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Contract_Acknowledgement&gt;&gt; _Form.pdf&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ___________________________________&gt; &gt; SARA CONDE&gt; &gt; Consultant Services Advisor&gt; &gt; MBO Partners&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t: 703.793.6028&gt; &gt; f: 703.793.6068&gt; &gt; e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; &gt; w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential. &gt; They are intended solely for the use of the individual addressed.  If &gt; you have received this email in error please notify &gt; postmaster@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:postmaster@mbopartners.com&gt; and permanently delete the e-mail and files.&gt; &gt; </textOnly>
