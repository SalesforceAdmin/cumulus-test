    <subject>MBO Partners Independent Consulting Brief - August 2013</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
This month, I was privileged to sit on a panel with some of the best and brightest thinkers around the #futureofwork at SXSW V2V, a conference that brought together those who want to galvanize America’s start-up economy. America’s independent consultants and contractors have entered the start-up space as solopreneurs.


Read my post-mortem blog &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/future-now&gt; on the event, and don’t forget to sign up to receive the 2013 State of Independence &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/independent-workforce-index.html&gt; report next month to catch exciting new data about the independent workforce.

TECHNOLOGY 101
Transitioning from traditional employment to independent consulting also shifts your view and use of technology. You move from being assigned tools to use to finding tools that support your business needs. You shift from being a user only to a key decision maker tasked with strategically implementing technology solutions for your business. New devices, gadgets, apps and services seem to be developed daily making it hard to keep up with the lingo yet alone the technology itself.


In this guide, we equip you with an approach that focuses less on the technology and more on the problems you need to solve for your business. This perspective provides you with a solid foundation for confidently assessing technology tools for your business.

Nicolette Taylor, a consultant services advisor for MBO Partners, tells the story of a retiring consultant who wasn’t ready to call it a day, but needed a change of scenery.  

“As consultants get closer to retirement, independence offers them a way to keep doing the work they love while also giving them an opportunity to start changing their lifestyle.”

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. How does MBO Partners fit in the picture with my new client?
A. It’s not a black and white answer – every client is different. For example, if you contract with an enterprise (such as a larger Fortune 500 company), you simply introduce us to your point of contact at the client and we handle all the paperwork, contract negotiation and vendor set-up (even the business insurances that might be required).

If your client is a smaller firm, or someone you have a pre-existing work relationship qith, your statement of work process can be different. Our job at MBO is to serve you – so we cater to the way you want to work with your client and provide the protection and ease of administration that you are looking for, whatever your client scenario may be. It’s why we call our service ‘white glove’ and why we successfully retain so many independent consultants as long term associates.
