It speaks to the value propositions from the client&apos;s perspective. For future reference it is also on my landing page &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/advisor-info-s-conde.html&gt;. This is a good page to bookmark because it should have most everything you need and then you won’t have to go looking through old emails to find a PDF attachment or a random link.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks!Sara__________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Question Hi Sara, I have a question.  I might be teaming with another IMC consultant to bid on a project.  He would prefer that our relationship be &apos;closer&apos; than a prime-sub relationship so he would like me to work as a 1099.  I would like to offer and explore with him whether it might make sense for him to consider using MBO to get to me.   Do you have a standard pitch designed that might help clients understand this approach? Mike --______________________________________________Michael GalloValerisys Consulting301.448.7578 (p)888.400.8199 (f) Web:  http://www.valerisys.com &lt;http://www.valerisys.com&gt;Twitter:  http://www.twitter.com/valerisys &lt;http://www.twitter.com/valerisys&gt;LinkedIn:  http://www.linkedin.com/in/gallomichael &lt;http://www.linkedin.com/in/gallomichael&gt; </textOnly>
