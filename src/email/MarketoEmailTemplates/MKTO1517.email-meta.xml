Subject: Re: MBO Partners Follow Up Hi Nicolette,   Thanks for your note.  I am definitely still interested but haven&apos;t had time to fully determine if this is something I&apos;m ready to sign up for.  I am still in start up mode with my business and am very focused on landing new clients.  I will follow through on the further info you sent this month and hope to have an update for you mid July based on my schedule.     Best, Kym
