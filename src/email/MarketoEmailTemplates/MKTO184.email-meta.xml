    <subject>Important Announcement from MBO Partners: New Look and Business Center Interface!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{company.First Name (A):default=MBO Alumni}},
 
My name is Marcelle Saab, MBO Partners’ new program manager responsible for interaction with our Associates and Alumni. I’m happy to share with you that MBO Partners is launching a refreshed brand to the marketplace. See here: http://www.mbopartners.com/news-events/mbo-partners-unveils-comprehensive-program-power-independent-consulting-america
 
MBO Partners has been growing quickly. As businesses migrate to the new Project Economy with more and more work being procured on a contract basis, we have emerged as a leader in helping independent workers and their clients work together. As a result, we’re compelled to enhance our messaging and demonstrate how MBO Partners is central to this growing trend.
 
Last month, MBO Partners launched a new look and feel throughout our organization, including a new Web site (www.mbopartners.com) and refreshed branding. Last week we also launched a new-and-improved user interface for the online Business Center that’s central to our Associate and client relationships.
 
We hope you take a moment to explore the new site.
 
As a result of these exciting changes, we’ve also been in the news recently. Here’s a few stories and links you may enjoy:
