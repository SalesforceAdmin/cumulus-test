Subject: Re: Mark, what could you do with more hours in your workday? Sara, I am a retired IT and engineering professional who worked for 33 years for a Fortune 500 company.  I am now being approached by several small companies to provide training and consulting expertise.   These opportunities are speculative at this point and I am discussing specifics with two companies. It appears MBO can help me and I was recommended to you by one of your independent consultants.   My question is, if I begin the process of signing up with MBO now, is there any problem if I am not working immediately.  As a retiree, work will be part time and sporadic.  Is there any problem if I am not billing for, perhaps, months between work. Thanks in advance for any information.  If you have any questions about my specific situation, let me know. Mark Faust  On Aug 20, 2013, at 2:00 PM, Sara Conde &lt;info@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:info@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:
