You are very welcome, I am pretty sure you have had to explain something to me more than once so let’s call it even. J  Keep me in the loop with Kevin, he is a great guy and I am looking forward to working with him. You really have a wonderful network of folks. Cheers,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: Kevin McCarron You totally rock Sara!
This does make sense - and this is actually a second time you explain this to me - thanks for your patience as well :)

He has a face-to-face tomorrow, assuming all goes good - I&apos;ll set the bill rate with TWC right after that. If the numbers are right - I&apos;ll be able to make a decision if we keep $55 or increase a tad more. 
 
Thanks,

Subject: RE: Kevin McCarronHi Mike, We show 1920 hours to set more realistic expectations for the consultant since we know they can’t work 40hrs. every single week of the year (which is what 2080 represents.)  I attached another estimate that shows $65.30 x 173.3 hrs. a month = 2080 hrs. a year. You can see we come out around 115k. So we are still working off the right number and if Kevin is going to work 40 hours every single week he could perhaps expect to make 115k. However, since he will likely take some time off for vacation and sick time we show 106k to set expectations. Let me know if this makes sense.

Subject: RE: Kevin McCarron Hi Sara,
Perhaps I miscalculated the rate when I was asking for the $55/hr - I based my calculations on 2080 hrs/year where you calculate based on 1920 which makes for a 160 hrs difference. I know we discussed this before, but would you remind me why is the total hours/year calculated differently.
We may need to adjust the rate than since I want to come up to $115K/year W-2 and based on $55/hr it comes to ~$106K if we count 1920 hrs/year

Mike

Subject: Kevin McCarronHi Mike, I just spoke with Kevin; he is a great fit for our program. The billable rate for you will be $63.50 per hour to get him an average around $55 per hour W-2 annually. I have attached the estimate for your review (see highlighted areas.) Month one he averages $51.54 per hour W-2 (take the gross W-2 pay and divide by 160 hrs. a month), mid-month (when he hits the tax caps) he averages $55.52 per hour W-2 and annually he averages $55.18 per hour W-2 (take annual gross W-2 pay divide by 192o hrs.)  Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks! ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
