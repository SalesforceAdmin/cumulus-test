Thanks!Sara From: Joan Trant [mailto:joantrant@gmail.com]

The time has been approved. There is no problem with you using that name – also I really like it! It may be worth looking into filing a DBA (doing business as) so that you have the rights to the name, not necessary but just a thought. Have a great weekend!Sara From: Joan Trant [mailto:joantrant@gmail.com &lt;mailto:joantrant@gmail.com&gt;]

Subject: Re: Automatic reply: my time cards are on their way!! Sara, my time cards are submitted through June.  I am now working on submitting the past three weeks time cards and also inputting expenses. I have a question: I want to use a name for my consulting work that reflects the type of service I am providing.  I have come up with the following: Joan TrantCEOSOPHIA - Social Philanthropy and Investment AdvisorsM +1 917 763 6361 &lt;tel:%2B1%20917%20763%206361&gt;skype: joan.trantjoantrant@gmail.com &lt;mailto:joantrant@gmail.com&gt;Sophia, wisdom in Greek, is the combination of knowledge, insight and judgment.

I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any problem with me using this, but if there is, please let me know.   Thanks again, JoanOn Thu, Jul 26, 2012 at 3:43 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Thank you for your message. I am at an off-site meeting for the rest of the day and will have limited access to voicemail and email.
