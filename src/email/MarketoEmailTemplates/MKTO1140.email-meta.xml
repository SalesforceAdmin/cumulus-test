This is something that I have to create, but don’t worry, it’s very easy for me to do so. Please feel free to send any other metrics that you would like to see.

Subject: net cash once more Hi Sarah,  When you get a chance, could run the net cash again with my selections @ $76/hr?  Is this something I can do from the Business center? hp</textOnly>
