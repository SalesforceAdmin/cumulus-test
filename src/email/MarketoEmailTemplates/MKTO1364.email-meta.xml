Subject: RE: Adva Optival setup with MBO Partners Dear James ,  On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with your firm. MBO Partners caters to two markets.  Our first service is designed for independent consultants and  small businsses who choose to plug into our MBO Services Cloud to make it easier for them to work with their clients.  We take care of all the back office administrative, HR, regulatory and financial issues so they can stay focused on delivering on their services.  The second is how we help enterprise organizations engage more efficently and safely with their contract workforce.  We have also put together a short one page collateral that explains how we work and the markets we serve. Attached is the standard agreement and statement of work we use when engaging our Associates with their clients.  Please review and complete it, and return a signed copy to me. And, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thanks again, and I look forward to working with you.   Best regards,Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
