Subject: RE: MBO Partners Follow Up Nicolette, I have been a sub contractor and/or a 1099 consultant for the last 7 years.  The only service that I know I need is for someone to carry my security clearance and to have the contract vehicles for the government to pay me.  Do you offer those services?    Thanks,Lenard On Mon, Feb 27, 2012 at 3:14 PM, Nicolette Taylor wrote:  Dear Lenard,  I received your information from Emily Dyche and wanted to take a moment to reach out and introduce myself.   She mentioned that while you will not be working through Booz Allen at this time, that you may be interested in utilizing our services for other consulting opportunities and wanted some additional information about our program.   Ill be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services and answer any specific questions you may have.   You may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by postmaster@mbopartners.com &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9b3B0ZWNoQGNoYXJ0ZXIubmV0JnVpZD0wJmV4dHJhPU1URXlmSE55WTJsa1BUazNmRzFoYVd4cFpEMDBNRGRsWVRrNFl5MWpZbVUwTFRRMFlXRXRZalUxT0MweE5EZzRNalEyTUdFNFlqUXRPVGQ4Wm5KdmJUMXVkR0Y1Ykc5eVFHMWliM0JoY25SdVpYSnpMbU52Ylh4emRXSnFQVTFDVHlCUVlYSjBibVZ5Y3lCR2IyeHNiM2NnVlhBPT0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCdEFNsER%2By%2F%2BRI7v5mieOdJ280dYXY52MuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;going here.  You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube.   I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners!   Nicolette     ___________________________________ Nicolette Taylor Consultant Services Advisor MBO Partners   t: 703.793.6281 f: 703.793.6456 e: ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
