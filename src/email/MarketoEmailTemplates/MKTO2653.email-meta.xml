I wanted to follow up on your message below and my voicemail. MBO is an alternative to incorporating so there is no need to file any legal documentation. However, if you would like to ensure that no one can use the name “Intrinsic Matters” it may be worthwhile to get it as a DBA, but no legal entity would need to be created. Once you are a member we do have a networking community called “MBO Access &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Access_Information.pdf?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCcVRfs0tW6e6WLaL%2BnDrOaY2kr7VzDrrq3sxw2kdzGIalUg%3D%3D&gt;” where you can promote your skills and potentially hook up with other MBO members. I also see you are using the LinkedIn Group which is great.  Give me a ring when you have a few moments to discuss.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Patrick Schoof Hello Sara,

I have the potential of working with a consulting firm that would like me to sign their NDA.  

First, if I were to work with them through MBO Partners, what would first need to be done on my part to be operating separate from self employment?  Does Intrinsic Matters need a DBA, Incorporated status, other?  

Second, how would you recommend that I promote availability to other MBO Partners throughout your network? 

If this can be done well, and soon, I am now able and willing to become very active?

Patrick
