Subject: MBO PartnersHi Paul, Per our call I wanted to summarize the tax scenarios we spoke about: Traditional W-2 ·         Typically 6.2% Social Security (4.2% in 2012 due to 2%  temporary tax cut)·         1.45 % Medicare·         Federal withholding (based on W-4 elections)·         Local and state withholding (based on W-4 elections) 1099·         Typically 15.3% self-employment tax (12.4% Social Security and 2.9% Medicare double the traditional W-2 responsibility)  ** note 13.3% in 2012 due to temporary Social Security 2% tax cut**·         Federal withholding (based of AGI)·         Local and state withholding (based of AGI) MBO:·         Typically 12.4% Social Security (10.4% in 2012 due to temporary 2% Social Security tax cut) ·         2.9% Medicare·         .8% FUTA (federal unemployment) ·         SUTA  (state unemployment rate depends on sate)·         1% Workmens compensation ·         Federal withholding (based on W-4 elections)·         Local and state withholding (based on elections) Again, MBO is an alternative to running your own business which many consultants have found to be a valuable service. Most of the consul who enjoy using MBO Partners value their time hence enjoy the convenience as an alternative to managing it on their own.  For in depth review of our services please visit http://www.mbopartners.com/#whoweare  and see how we compare to 1099 by visiting http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_vs_1099_Comparison.pdf  We are a 100% optional service. Regards,Sara  ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
