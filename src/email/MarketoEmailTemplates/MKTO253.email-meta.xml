Dear Harris,
 
You had recently shared your information with MBO Partners, and as a courtesy, I wanted to follow up on the voicemail I left you.  I wanted to introduce myself as the person at MBO Partners responsible for all new associate and partnership requests. I am including my contact information.  And, so you may easily book a time that is convenient for you, I am including a link tomy online schedule: https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK
 
You can also watch a short video about who we are on youtube: (same comment as above – why YouTube?)

I look forward to speaking with you,
 
Nicolette
