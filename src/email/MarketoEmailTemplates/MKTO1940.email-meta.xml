I’ll be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services and answer any specific questions you may have. I tried reaching out to you on the number provided below and got a message that said the number was not in service. Is there a better number to reach you at? You may reach out to me directly, or you may easily re-book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here &lt;https://my.timedriver.com/8SLYS&gt;.  You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube &lt;http://youtu.be/zKDzwSTmGv4&gt;. I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners! Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
