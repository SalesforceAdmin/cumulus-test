He heard about us after reading the HBR article. He has his own consulting company currently, Cornerstone Advisory Partners and he is the sole owner, but has 6 other partners that do different types of work and they go out and find work and help each other get placed on projects. Mostly business/executive coaching and other strategy/process based work. He was very interested in our model and thinks it might be a good fit for him because right now he is managing all of the admin of the business on his own and wants a better way to do it. Depending on how he envisions the setup we will be a good fit for him. I sent him follow up information and he will review and follow up with me to brainstorm different setup possibilities ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;bbentley@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
