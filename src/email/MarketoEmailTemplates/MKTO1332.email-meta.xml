The image is a bit light and blurry so if you could take it again that would be much appreciated. I also need a picture of your US passport. Again, both can be sent over email. Did you see the email sent to you asking for your permission to sign the SOW? I will go ahead and resend it again, Thanks! ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
