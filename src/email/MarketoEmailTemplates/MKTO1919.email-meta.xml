    <subject>HCI Webcast: HR executive roundtable on independent contractor talent management</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

I thought this upcoming webcast could be helpful to you.  It is HR focused, but appropriate for anyone interested in listening in on a panel of HR and Talent Acquisition executives who will discuss best practices in the human capital management of their independent contract talent. 

Webcast: Why HR Should Own Independent Contract Talent Management and How to Do It

Date: Wednesday, Sept 12, 2012 at 12:00pm EST 

(Not a good time for you? There are recasts on Sept 13 and 14 also available to you)

Registration: Click here to register &lt;http://www.hci.org/lib/why-hr-should-own-independent-contract-talent-management-and-how-do-it&gt; 

We are anticipating a great turnout and hope you can join the discussion. If you think this may not be right for you, but you have a colleague who might be interested, please consider passing this invite along.

Kind regards,
 Steve
