You have given us everything we need. So the next step would be to introduce me to this client via email and then I can reach out via phone to get the contract process started. I am excited for you to run your first project through us!
 
Sara

Sara,
 
Where are we in the process? I have a small ($2K) engagement I need to get rolling in the next few days. Will be a perfect start for the process given that this is a long-time client with a very simple deliverable.
 
Tom
