    <subject>How do you manage your compliance risk?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=friend of MBO Partners}},


Our clients have been telling us for years that since MBO Partners implemented their IC Compliance and Engagement Program, they are confident 
their risk of IC misclassification has virtually been eliminated. So when Aberdeen Group’s Human Capital practice published their recent research report, &quot;How much do 
you value your independent contractors?&quot;, I was excited to see that risk is considerably lower when using an IC Engagement Specialist (ICES) like MBO Partners. Additionally, 96% of hiring managers are satisfied with their ICs and 93% of those ICs are satisfied with their clients, which is an average of more than 30% higher than non-ICES companies.
 
Of course, we are not the only ICES a company can choose, but we are the largest, we’ve been doing it the longest, and we are the preferred engagement option for the ICs.

Download the full report here &lt;http://v1.aberdeen.com/includes/asp/sponsored_registration.asp?ci=/launch/report/benchmark/8489-RA-independent-contractor-engagement.asp&amp;spid=30411505&amp;camp=&gt; or just give us a call. We’ll explain how you can rest easy and know your risk is virtually eliminated.
