Thanks for your reply.  To answer your question is tough because it might vary based on the client we are working with.  In some situations when the client is creditworthy we will deposit funds for the worker once the invoice is delivered; however in most cases we pay the worker once we receive payment from the client; there are no guarantee’s of payment.  If the client does not pay, we do not pay.  
I hope this helps answer your question.
 
Steve

I would be interested for future employment; I am currently under contract at Point Beach until April 2012. If I were to get an early release, I would expect it would be to assist down at St Luce.
 
I have recently heard of a situation where MBO partners went extended periods without receiving a check; this was after the initial 40 something day waiting period. Does MBO have a plan with additional maintenance charges to assure their partner’s to receive a check every pay period? If so, please provide the details to include the length of the initial waiting period
 
Thanks and have a Happy new Year

Dear Steven,

Along the way, you shared with us that you have considered independent consulting as a career path. We appreciate your interest in our company and the topic of independence. It&apos;s a subject we are passionate about.

Each year, we observe a surge in interest around the topic just after the holidays from connections new and old. You may be interested in participating in our pre-New-Years Webinar:

Title: Is Independent Consulting Right For You?

Date/Time: Tomorrow, 12/30, at 12:30 PM EST

Or just reading about our point of view in a recent posting we did.

Steve
