    <subject>Reputation Management: New Guide from MBO Partners</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Consultant}},
Billionaire investor Warren Buffet once said: &quot;It takes 20 years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to ruin it.&quot;
You may believe you are doing all the right things to manage your reputation: you show up to meetings on time, you attend the appropriate networking events and you exceed client expectations on every project. However, you may be blind to the fact that someone gave you a negative review online that comes up when someone searches for your name. 
Our new downloadable guide on Reputation Management &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide/grow/reputation-management&gt; will give you tips and tools to help you ensure that your brand is reflected in the best light, both online and offline. Review the content to make sure your reputation is helping your business, not hurting it.
