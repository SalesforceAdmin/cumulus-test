There are two things I will need to complete your registration: ·         Copy of your last pay stub from 2012·         For you to purchase liability insurance that we have flowed down from IBM: Please give the requirements below to your insurance broker and have MBO Partners, Inc. listed as holder on the certificate of insurance once this is completed, send on over to me.  Here are the requirements: H.18 HSAR 3052.228-70 (DEC 2003) Insurance In accordance with the clause entitled ?Insurance - Work on a Government Installation&quot; [or Insurance - Liability to Third Persons] in Section I, insurance of the following kinds and minimum amounts shall be furnished at any time at the request of the CO and maintained during the period of performance of this contract: a.

If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer&apos;s liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a contractor&apos;s commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage. Employer&apos;s liability coverage of at least $100,000 shall be required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers&apos; compensation to be written by private carriers. (See 28.305(c) for treatment of contracts subject to the Defense Base Act.)(b) General liability. (1) The contracting officer shall require bodily injury liability insurance coverage written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $500,000 per occurrence.(2) Property damage liability insurance shall be required only in special circumstances as determined by the agency.(c) Automobile liability. The contracting officer shall require automobile liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy. The policy shall provide for bodily injury and property damage liability covering the operation of all automobiles used in connection with performing the contract. Policies covering automobiles operated in the United States shall provide coverage of at least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and $20,000 per occurrence for property damage. The amount of liability coverage on other policies shall be commensurate with any legal requirements of the locality and sufficient to meet normal and customary claims.  I recall you saying that you wanted insurance broker referral, so I wanted to pass along my contact at The Insurance Exchange is: Michael Cronin, CLCS
