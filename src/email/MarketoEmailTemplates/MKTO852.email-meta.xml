Hi Sara, 
Hope you are well and had a nice weekend. Enclosed is a link with all the documentation…and more that you requested. The only documentation I don’t have is “Professional Liability Insurance”. Please let me know if that is an issue.

Hi Tim,
 
Nice “e-meeting” you too.  Your corporate tax year end fillings for 2010 would be great along with current P&amp;L for 2011.  What we really need to see is proof that you are paying yourself a fair W-2 wage from your S-Corp.
 
Thanks Tim,
Sara

Hi Sara,
Nice to “e-meet” you. 
As for the list of outstanding items, I will provide you with everything except proof professional liability insurance. Do you need my corporate tax year end filings for 2010 and current P&amp;L for 2011? I will follow up with you tomorrow with all documentation.

Hi Tim,
 
My name is Sara Conde, I work with Steve Arhancet and I will be working with you to finish up your vender registration. Right now we need the supporting documents before we can move forward. I have attached a cover page that lists what we need.  I will also need a copy of you W-2 from 2010 and 2011 (if you have it.) If not, please provide me with a YTD paystub from your s-corp. 
 
Please send these items to me directly via email or fax. 
 
I look forward to working with you!
 
Sara
