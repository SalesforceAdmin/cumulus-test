I will send you the link to enroll in our system and you can navigate to our site to complete the enrollment when you are ready to do so.  Since we wont be activating you until the end of the year it is not a big hurry to get this completed.  Once you have finished the enrollment online there will be an enrollment packet you can print off and in that packet is an I9 form.  You will just need to take this to a local notary and have them sign as an authorized representative and then fax or email the copy back to me.  Once I have the I9 and your enrollment is complete I will just wait to activate you until your project starts.  Please let me know if you have any questions about this.
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Thank you Nicolette!  I just sent HPH a signed Business Associate Agreement, so I think the paperwork is all set now.
 
As far as any setup I need to do with MBO Partners, what would be the timing/process on that?
 
Thanks,  Lisa
