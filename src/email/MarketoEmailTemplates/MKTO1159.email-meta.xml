It will be returned to you when you leave MBO (if it is never used.) Your benefits are effective 4.1.12 and you were charged the first actual premium cost. ·         MacTurtor – We are moving along Robert needs to sign our contract and then I can get them set up. You will be copied on all correspondence. ·         City of Norwalk - Our payments post after 2pm today, so I will know if it came in at that point. I will still reach out to inquire when/if they have made payment and by what method.   Thank you,
