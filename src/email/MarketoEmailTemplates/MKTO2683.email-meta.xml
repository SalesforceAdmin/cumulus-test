Thank you for downloading content from The Independent&apos;s Guide! I hope you found it helpful.

I wanted to let you know that MBO Partners provides independent consultants like you with more valuable resources. Here are three places to get started:


 - The Independent Consulting Brief &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independent-consulting-brief&gt;: Our monthly newsletter packed with tips, events, and relevant content tailored to independent consultants.
 - Independent Consulting Webinar Series &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/SeriesSign-up_RegistrationPage.html&gt;: Each month, we invite guest experts to come speak on a variety of topics affecting independents.
