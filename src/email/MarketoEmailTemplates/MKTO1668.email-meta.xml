Subject: RE: Canceled: Abdullah Bozgeyik - MBO Partners Conversation Hi Nicolette,

I see.. It is OK.. But what does &quot;MBO does not support foreign employment at this point in time&quot; mean? 

Did you think that I applied for a job at your company?


My points at my previous message were basicaly 2 questions;

Do you have any MBO partner here in Turkey mainly in Istanbul?

I would like hear more about your services and possible contributions to a freelance consultant like me after 14 years of experience  ?

Briefly I&apos;ve been working as a frelance/independent consultant since 1998, plus my other professional hats.

So far what I understand is MBOpartners... does not have any partner in Turkey and MBO partners does not serve or cooperate with consultants outside of states..

Thanks. No, I do not have any more questions..

Have a great day.

Best wishes,

Abdullah Bozgeyik
