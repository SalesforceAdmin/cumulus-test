Subject: Julie Curtis (ID: 20320 )  Good Afternoon Sara, While reviewing Julie’s recently submitted Comcast – Phone and Internet expenses dated 4/19/12 I noticed that the associate seems to be underestimating the amount that they can expense. The associate had entered this expense using the date 4/15/2012 but going forward make sure they enter the expense using either the bill/statement date or if that is not available then use the ending date of the billing period. Please see my calculations below: ·         4/19/12: Communications- Phone Service – Comcast for $32.06 (Associates entry)o   First take the cost of the plan which is $134.99 then divide by three (TV, Internet, Phone) to arrive at $44.97o   Then take the phone specific charges and add them in:§  Additional voice services + $1.29§  Voice Taxes + $6.93·         This brings the total to $53.19 then adjust the expense percentage to 58% because that is what the associate entered. ·         4/19/12: Communications- Internet Service – Comcast for $32.06 (Associates entry)o   First take the cost of the plan which is $134.99 then divide by three (TV, Internet, Phone) to arrive at $44.97o   Then take the Internet specific charges and add them in:§  Data Modem Rental +$7.00§  Internet Taxes + $0.56·         This brings the total to $52.53 then adjust the expense percentage to 58% because that is what the associate entered.  ·         4/01/12: Communications – Phone expense – Verizon for 443-928-8125 – $86.65 (Associates entry)o   The associate needs to make sure the change the expense date to the ending date of the billing period. (Billing Period = 02/07/12 – 03/06/12) This means that the date this expense should be entered as is 3/06/12 ·         5/01/12: Communications – Phone expense – Verizon for 443-928-8125 – $70.58 (Associates entry)o   The associate needs to make sure the change the expense date to the ending date of the billing period. (Billing Period = 03/07/12 – 04/06/12) This means that the date this expense should be entered as is 4/06/12  Financial Services Specialist IMBO Partners  &lt;/bo</textOnly>
