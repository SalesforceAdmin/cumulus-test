Subject: Re: I-9 Sara, I&apos;ll get the mail out to you and Sebastian.  Do set up reporting on an hourly basis - thanks!On Wed, Jul 11, 2012 at 3:10 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Hi Joan, Thank you so much. Yes, an email would suffice, please send it and I will attach to my system. Also, do you want to bill in the unit of hours or in the unit of days? Right now I have it set to bill $500 a day but if we are going to work of $70 per hour I am assuming you will want to track your hours and bill that way. Just let me know, either is fine with me. 
Thanks!Sara From: Joan Trant [mailto:joantrant@gmail.com &lt;mailto:joantrant@gmail.com&gt;]

Subject: Re: I-9 Very sorry for the oversight on the I-9.  Here you go...finally! There is one final step before we can process payroll: confirming the hourly payment rate.  Sebastian and I have been discussing whether the hourly rate should be $70 or $62.50; we are basically determining if the daily rate is divided by seven hours or eight.   In my work with consultants in our field, they quote a seven hour day.  MicroRate&apos;s standard consultant contract is $500 for an eight hour day. Sebastian has agreed to the $70 rate for the next two quarters, and then as sales commission opportunities kick in, he would like to reduce the hourly rate to $62.50, to bring our contract back in line with MicroRate&apos;s standard arrangement.  I have agreed to the $70 rate, and to revisit this discussion in six months. As a result, Sebastian prefers to maintain the Master Agreement quoting a daily rate with an email that confims the current hourly rate (which may or may not change, pending our ongoing discussions). Would an email to you and cc&apos;g Sebastian that confirms the $70/hour payment rate be sufficient for your documentation?  Pls advise and if so I&apos;ll send that email next.   Thanks, Joan-- Joan Trant

Subject: Re: I-9 Sara, welcome back...hope your mini-holiday was wonderful.   I only have Adobe Reader, not Acrobat, and therefore cannot do a password protection for the I-9.  I have attached it and my passport copy...pls delete this message and attached docs from your email inbox and from your delete folder, and request other handlers to download them and delete them from any other online locations immediately. Thanks, Joan Joan Trant

Subject: FW: I-9 Hi Joan, My name is Nicolette and I am backing up Sara while she is out of the office until Monday.  To answer your questions, faxes get routed to our email directly.  What I would suggest is scanning in the document, and password protecting it with the last 4 of your SSN.  If you would like to wait until Sara is back in the office to work with her on this, she will be back on Monday and you and her can discuss your options.   Please let me know if you have any additional questions and if there is anything I can help you with I would be happy to assist you while Sara is out. Have a great day,Nicolette From: Sara Conde

Subject: I-9Hi, Sara! I got the notary signature on the I-9 and want to send it to you. Asyo know, I&apos;m sensitive about my SS# being on a doc floating in cyberspace.  Two questions:   - Does your fax convert to an email?  If not, I&apos;ll fax the doc.  If your faxes get delivered to you as email, it doesn&apos;t make sense to send the I-9 via fax.    - Are you in the office today?  If it makes sense to fax the form, I don&apos;t want it sitting by the fax machine and possibley getting misplaced.  Thanks, Joan
