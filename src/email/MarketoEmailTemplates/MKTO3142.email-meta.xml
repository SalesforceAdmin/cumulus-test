    <subject>{{lead.First Name:default=Consultant}}, webinar on finding new clients</subject>
    <textOnly>Please join us on Thursday, February 27 at 1 p.m. ET, when we will hold a webinar titled &quot;Painless Prospecting for Independent Consultants &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/webinars/2014/painless-prospecting-independent-consultants&gt;.&quot;

The independent lifestyle comes with significant benefits; flexible hours, work-life balance, and the ability to choose what you do and who you do it for. However, it also presents a significant challenge: where will your next contract come from?
To help independents keep new business rolling in, MBO Partners welcomes author and digital strategist Tom Martin to our webinar series. Martin will walk you through creating content, positioning that content where your audience will see it, and optimizing your website to turn those leads into clients.
Register today &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/webinars/2014/painless-prospecting-independent-consultants&gt; to be entered for a chance to win one of 30 copies of Tom&apos;s book, The Invisible Sale &lt;http://conversedigital.com/theinvisiblesale/&gt;.
