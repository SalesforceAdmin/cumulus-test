Thank you for getting this to me!  I will review the contract now and send it to my contracts team for approval on any changes and then send it back to Karen for her review with the changes tracked on the document.  If there is anything that directly impacts you that we will have to sign off on I will let you know and I will copy you on my reply to Karen.
 
Thank you,
 
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette,
 
As promised, the paperwork and Karen&apos;s contact information.  She sent them in word in the event that having track changes would be helpful.  Again, she indicated that she would not be available this afternoon but will be looking at e-mail this evening.
 
Thanks.
Milena
