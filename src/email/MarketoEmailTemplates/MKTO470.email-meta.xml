Thanks for the reply.  We’ll definitely be here when you make the switch.  We’re going to be coming out with some really neat webinars (probably one a month) where we will have some key speakers that are top notch. We’ll be sure to invite you to them so you can stay in touch.  
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Thanks for following up, Steven.  I am currently a salaried employee at Intel, working on a project that I&apos;m very much enjoying (3D graphics support on Linux).  However, consulting work is still a definite possibility for my future, and if and when that time comes, I would definitely be interested in working with MBO Partners.

Until then, I&apos;ll keep you in my address book.  Best wishes.

Paul

Dear Paul,

It’s been some time since we last spoke with you, but I personally wanted to check in and share some news with you. We recently launched a new consultant-focused Web site which includes relevant tools such as a Bill Rate Calculator, a self-assessment tool on independence, and a video that shows how we help independents succeed in today’s project economy. We encourage you to take a look.

Whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.

Please feel free to reply to this email and provide an update on how your contract search is going. Are you working on a project now or you currently working W2 at the moment?
