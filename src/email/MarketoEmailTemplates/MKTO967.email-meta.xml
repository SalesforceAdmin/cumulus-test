On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with your firm.
 
MBO Partners caters to two markets.  Our first service is designed for independent consultants and  small businsses who choose to plug into our MBO Services Cloud to make it easier for them to work with their clients.  We take care of all the back office administrative, HR, regulatory and financial issues so they can stay focused on delivering on their services.  The second is how we help enterprise organizations engage more efficently and safely with their contract workforce.  We have also put together a short one page collateral that explains how we work and the markets we serve.
 
Attached is the standard agreement and statement of work we use when engaging our Associates with their clients.  Please review and complete it, and return a signed copy to me. And, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thanks again, and I look forward to working with you.  
 
Best regards,
 
Sara

Hi Mr. Rowe,
 
I have copied Sara Conde on this email. She is with MBO Partners, a firm I have contracted with to manage client billing,  service contracts, and a few other back-office functions. She will send you what you need, contract-wise and be able to answer questions related to the contract.
 
(Sara - please send Gary Rowe, Chairman of Northern Federal Credit Union, the MBO master service agreement.)    
 
In the interim, I will send you the latest CUES salary survey data so you can see where Dan sits currently as compared to the salary target. I will also work on setting up the salary survey system online - and I assume you need a printable copy for Ms. Pennock?
 
Tom

Will do! By the way, we have a new contract process tied to a new back office company we have signed up with. Do you want me to just send it along to Dan, or do you want to look at it/review it yourself?

Feel free to start working on the project at your earliest convenience.
 
Thanx

Greetings Gary Rowe!
 
Just a quick note to check in and see whether you all need assistance pulling together Dan&apos;s 2011 assessment and with checking the 2012 salary survey benchmark data. Let me know when you have a sec, and if you do need assistance we will gather all the details for you in short order!
 
Hope all is well in the great North East!
 
Tom
