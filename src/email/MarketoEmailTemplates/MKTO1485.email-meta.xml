I am also going to have Kelly enter your new work order with Prism Communications as soon as Ananth sends me back the Work Order with the information I need for invoicing, etc. Kelly will be reaching out to you shortly to introduce herself.   Regards, Nicolette  ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;bbentley@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
