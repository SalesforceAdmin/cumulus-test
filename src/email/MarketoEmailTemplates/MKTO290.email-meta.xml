You are welcome.  I found out from support there is no way to complete the re-enrollment by skipping the contract to get to the remainder of the information.  You will need to first electronically sign, then complete the remainder of the process.  Please let me know if you have any questions about this and when you finish reviewing the contract please email any questions you have or any proposed changes so I may look at them with our contracts team.

Thank you,
Nicolette

Hi Denise,
 
Thank you for sending me your agreement.  MBO Partners, Inc. is a consultant services company specifically set up to administer contract assignments for independent consultants.  Individuals utilize our services in lieu of self-incorporating, and as such become our w2 employee. Our model avails them of many of the same benefits as self-incorporating but without the difficulties typically encountered in becoming a freelancer. For your purposes, we operate similarly to most of the staffing companies you may deal with, except that we do not recruit or find engagements for our consultants: they do that on their own. If you would like a more in-depth view of our services, please visit www.mbopartners.com. 
 
 
With this in mind, Ive attached an amended contract with the changes highlighted.  Here is an explanation of each change: 
 
·        Section 1b - We cannot warrant the services provided by the consultant
 
·        Section 2a  We do not recruit nor interview our consultants
 
·        Section 2c  We cannot warrant the consultants skill set.  
 
·        Section 2d  We do not staff nor recruit, and therefore cannot agree to replace any personnel
 
·        Section 7c - We prefer to remove this requirement, as it is an additional cost to the consultant, however, if it cannot be removed, then we will be sure to obtain
 
·        Section 8  We do not staff or recruit, but rather provide W2 services for independent consultants and are likely working with clients in the same industry and/or billing your clients for other consultants Therefore, we need to add the attached language to non-compete/solicitations so that we are not in immediate breach.
 
·        Section 10  we prefer to use our standard indemnification language
 
 
 
If my changes are acceptable, please sign and fax or email the attached PDF version of the contract.  Please dont hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thanks again, and we look forward to working with you.   
 
Have a great day,
