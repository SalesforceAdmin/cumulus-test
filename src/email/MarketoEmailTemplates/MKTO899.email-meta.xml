Thank you for following up with me!  Before I send you the enrollment information I need to know whether you will be working with BAH or with another company that you were working on getting a contract with?  This will determine what enrollment link I send you and if you will be forwarded to an enrollment manager on the BAH team.  Please let me know and we can always follow up on another short call to talk about details.
 
Please follow my calendar link from earlier emails to schedule a time if you would like to speak or just give me a call sometime tomorrow.
 
I look forward to hearing from you!
 
Have a great evening,
Nicolette

Nicholette,
 
Good Morning! Well, we have made some good progress this week and I think we&apos;re ready to enroll me into your program. I suspect that we&apos;ll need to set up another call to work the details so I will enter into your scheduler to select a time for my Wife and I to chat with you.
 
We look forward to the next steps...

Nicolette,
 
Thanks for all of this information. I&apos;ll need a day or so to sort through it. I&apos;ll call you with questions by weeks end.
 
Thanks again,

Hi Harry,
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you today.  I’ve enclosed a few resources that you might find helpful in finding your next project.  
 
We have created an index of past webinars on topics specifically catered for independent consultants.  You can view our index by going here.   
In addition we have a 2012 Webinar track that will cover everything to do with working independently.  We have three tracks, you can sign up to receive notifications when new webinars are scheduled by going here. 
Lastly, you can view all the information we spoke over the phone by going here.   
If you have questions before then, feel free to schedule a convenient time for you using my online schedule.
 
Best of luck finding your next contract,
 
 
Nicolette
