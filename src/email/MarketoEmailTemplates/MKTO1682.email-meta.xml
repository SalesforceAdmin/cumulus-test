This will not be an issue for you as it usually done within in a week of becoming active with MBO.  You are all set to get these funds paid out on Friday.

Subject: Re: MBO Partners Payment Notification for Kevin McCarron (20841) Thanks, Sara.

What is the &apos;pre-note&apos; process?  I was just looking at the Direct Deposit settings and saw this.

Are there any final edits that need to be made in order for payroll to post this Friday?
