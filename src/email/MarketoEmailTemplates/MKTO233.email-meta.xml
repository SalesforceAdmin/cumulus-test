Steve,

Sue Toorans suggested I get in touch with you.  I just picked up a contracting gig, and while EDD seems willing to forgive a little bit of 1099 work, I don&apos;t want to risk my ability to collect unemployment.  Plus, when it comes down to it, paperwork just isn&apos;t what I&apos;m good at.  

Apparently, your cut is about 5% off the top.  What is the lag time between the company paying you, and you paying me?  How would I set it up between you and them?

  Larry

 I go through mbopartners.com.  My contact is Steve Arhancet (703-793-6011)  sarhancet@mbopartners.com .  If you sign up, please
tell them I sent you. They handle
all the paperwork of a contract, once you&apos;ve landed it.  They send
the correct amount of dollars to the correct taxing agencies.  They
offer medical and dental (for a fee) and do a bunch more.  For this
service, they only charge 5% of the first $125k per year.  Their
percentage goes down for monies over 125k in a year.
