And you? Hi Jim, Please see the attached contract for your signature.  If you could actually send it back to me once you sign that would be great, I want to send the contract and the work order at the same time back to Mary. Thanks! From: Jim Sasena [mailto:jim@sasena.com] &lt;mailto:[mailto:jim@sasena.com]&gt;
