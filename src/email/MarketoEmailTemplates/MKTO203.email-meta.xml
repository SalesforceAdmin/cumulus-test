I haven’t heard anything back from Maria since I emailed her on Thursday evening.  Jason emailed me yesterday asking for a status update and I told him the situation and he said he would ask the vendor team what the progress what if any, but at this point unless someone higher up in the organization is looking at the agreement I don’t think anything will move forward with them.
 
I will reach out again today to see if there is any update and let you know.
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Ed –
It appears that MBO does not want to adhere to our MSA, and therefore we will not be able to work with them.  We still have the option of working with you on W2.  Please let me know your thoughts.
