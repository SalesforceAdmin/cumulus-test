I just sent the contract over to Denise with proposed changes and copied you on the email.  If you have questions about any of our changes please let me know.  I will keep you copied on correspondence between MBO and Daugherty so you will know the status as we go along.
 
Regarding our GSA,  I spoke with my manager and he let me know that the we will be unable to use the previous GSA you signed.  If you have proposed changes to the current document you may send those to me and I would be happy to discuss them with you.  I will not have any time to speak today but I am available Monday morning around 10:00am or between 11:30-1.  Please let me know if you are available and I am happy to reach out to you.
 
I look forward to speaking with you!
 
Have a great weekend,
 
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette,
 
I wanted to check with you to see if the agreement with Daugherty is now signed and in place.  Also, I wanted to ask if you would call me to discuss the GSA between myself and MBO.  I have questions about the GSA and would prefer to use the last agreement that was modified and put in place between myself and MBO.  Feel free to reach to call me on my cell.
