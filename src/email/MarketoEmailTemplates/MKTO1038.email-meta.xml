I wanted to follow upon the voicemail I just left you as well. We would be happy to add sections from your contract to our MSA. I would need to see what the sections would be before I can guarantee we could use them but I am sure we could work it out. When your contract is ready please send me the sections you were thinking about adding to our MSA. Take care,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: From: &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&quot;&gt;sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Hi Sara,
I&apos;ve already had a couple phone calls with MBO as I am considering using your services for one of my first customers to learn how you manage payroll, contracts and other aspects of a contract job.  My concern is regarding contracts that are presented to clients I will do work for.  

 I understand you already furnish standard contracts that protect consultants. I am having my own contract for software development created and reviewed by Internet attorneys.  So I&apos;d like to know if I can add some parts of that contract to yours should I use your services for this client.  If it&apos;s too messy then I may just perform the work under my own contract.

Thank You,
Pete
