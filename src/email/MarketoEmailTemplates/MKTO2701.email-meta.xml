SALES TIPS FOR INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONALS
Independent workers bear additional responsibility; they not only must perform their work, but find the work as well. Winning new contracts takes more than luck and a good body of work.

Putting off business development is not an option for the solo worker. Inconsistent business development can subject you to an inconsistent revenue stream.
