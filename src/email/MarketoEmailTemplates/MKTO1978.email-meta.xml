    <subject>MBO Partners Independent Consulting Brief - August 2012</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
The second annual State of Independence in America &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/news-events/mbo-partners%E2%80%99-second-annual-%E2%80%98state-independence%E2%80%99-career-study-suggests-independent-work-&gt; report is out. Not only has the population of independent workers in America increased by nearly a million more to 16.9 million – but independent workers are also more satisfied and less worried about overall work security. Contributing about one trillion dollars of revenue, independents also have a big impact on the overall economy and jobs. 2012 is the year we’ll remember for independent work going mainstream. I encourage you to view the report infographics &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/independent-workers.html&gt; or download the full study. &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/independent-workforce-index.html&gt;

5 TIPS FOR GETTING CLIENT REFERRALS
AND RECOMMENDATIONS
You’ve heard that word-of-mouth can be a powerful marketing tool for independent consultants, but you may be wondering how to get started. When potential clients hear about your qualifications directly from people they know and trust, it lends credibility to your reputation. Below are five tips you can use to help you gain referrals and recommendations from your clients. 

 1.    Prove Yourself First

Some independent consultants and small business owners ask for referrals shortly after landing a new client. However, it’s generally better to wait until after you’ve proven yourself to a client before you ask for a recommendation or referral. Asking a client for a referral immediately upon signing with them can come across as pushy, presumptuous, and even a bit desperate. These are not personality traits &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/six-personality-traits-successful-independent-consultants&gt; that make for a good first impression in a new working relationship. Also, a client may feel uncomfortable recommending you without a strong body of work. Impress them with your talent, skills and professionalism first, and they’ll have positive feedback to share with their contacts.

This month, we feature advisor Sara Conde, who shares how she helped a biotech expert set up an independent firm – and escape the constraints of her former full-time position. 

“While she had a Ph.D in biotechnology, she wasn’t interested in earning a Ph.D. in procurement and running a solo business. That’s where I was able to help her succeed.”

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. Does MBO Partners help me find work?
A. MBO Partners is an independent business management solution for solo professionals. We are often confused with a consulting firm or a staffing firm, but in fact our independent consulting clients (we called them “Associates”) are responsible for finding their own work. Recently, we introduced a new way to help Associates generate new work contracts. We launched MBO Access, a free, exclusive online community, where invited Associates and businesses who use MBO to manage independent contractors can freely learn more about one another and work together. The community works in three ways. First, it provides a library of tools and resources that empowers members to become more marketable and connected, which can lead to generating new business. Secondly, its allows our Associates to connect with others who choose to appear in search results based on keywords in their profile.  In a 3-month study conducted prior to the development of this community, MBO Partners learned that the path to a new project is typically driven by a personal introduction to someone with contacts in the right field or company.  Having the right connections can open the right doors. We also allow Associates to search our database of Master Service Agreements, making it easy to know which companies MBO already has a relationship with so you can more easily get through the doors of procurement once you find a project.

TESTIMONIAL
“If only I had known about MBO Partners in 2008! During that year, I was a 1099 contractor working for a great company in far-off countries and if I had known then what I know now about MBO Partners, I would have saved a lot of money when it came to taxes! MBO has provided me a personalized, professional business center that enables me to be successful”
