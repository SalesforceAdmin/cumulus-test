    <subject>Need to Know More About Independent Contractor Management?</subject>
    <textOnly>MBO Partners invites you to participate in a landmark study on how American enterprise organizations use and manage independent contractors. This important study will bring to light current IC-related issues and explore rapidly emerging practices and trends. 
 
The study is being conducted by Aberdeen Group, an independent research organization. As a professional with expertise in this area, we are confident that your input will add value to the quality of this research.
 
The survey is brief and should only take about 15 minutes to complete. MBO Partners will provide all participants with the final report later this year. If you would like to contribute more detailed feedback on the subject, please express that in the survey or contact Chris Dwyer, Aberdeen Group Analyst, at chris.dwyer@aberdeen.com.

As part of an overall effort to define the customer and consumers trends defining this critical sector, MBO Partners is simultaneously conducting a national survey on the size, trends and insights surrounding independent workforce in America. This landmark study – the first of its kind – also can be made available to your organization as a thank you for participation. Should you wish to receive it, please contact me at the e-mail address below. It’s our belief that better understanding this highly engaged and productive sub-set of the traditional workforce will be invaluable to C-suite leaders designing the model for the workforce of the future.

Sincerely,
