It was a pleasure speaking with you.  You’ll find everything that I referenced on our call by going here.
 
We are also promoting our new meet the independents project and are taking applications if you would like to be featured.  You can view the program by going here. 
 
I will follow up with you on Friday, as promised, should you have questions before then, please schedule a convenient time using my online schedule.
 
Best regards,
Sara
