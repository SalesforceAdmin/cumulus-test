As we discussed, I think there is some opportunity here to get you enrolled in our “Affiliate Program” which would compensate you for qualified referrals that you send our way. At this point in the process I would like to introduce you to David Putt (copied above) who will be your point of contact for set up in this program. He can be reached directly at 703-793-6020.  I also wanted to link you to my private landing page &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/advisor-info-s-conde.html&gt; so you can see some of the details of the program offering that we provide to our “MBO Exec’s”. This should give you a solid foundation on our services and some content to supplement our discussion today. Best to you!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!
