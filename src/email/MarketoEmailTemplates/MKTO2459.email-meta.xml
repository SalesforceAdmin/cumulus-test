She will also introduce you to MBO Access, our online community of consultants, valuable resources, and information about the organizations that use MBO to engage their consultants.  Abbey will be working to finish of the Bridgestone Contract as well as uploading the work order for your project with LLW Welding &amp; Fabrication. As your primary point of contact, Abbey will be able to offer you in-depth guidance on our programs, serving as your advocate to support you on any day-to-day issues regarding payments, invoices, expenses, and setting up new client contracts. I have reviewed your account history with Abbey and she looks forward to working with you.  Of course, I am always here to help with anything as well. Abbey will be reaching out to you soon to introduce herself and orient you to MBO Access, and she can always be reached directly at 703-793-6370 or aelliott@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:aelliott@mbopartners.com&gt;  It has been a real pleasure assisting you in your orientation to MBO Partners! Best regards, Nicolette  ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;bbentley@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt;   Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
