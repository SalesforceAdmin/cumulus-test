Will 2014 be the Year of &apos;BYOW&apos;?
MBO Predicts Top Workforce Trends
Each year MBO Partners offers insight on the top trends that will shape the American work and business landscape in the new year. In a recent press release &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/top-3-workforce-predictions-2014&gt;, MBO Partners predicts that 2014 will be the year of &quot;Bring Your Own Worker&quot; (BYOW) as companies and workers evolve their relationship, approaches and mindset about the 
future of work. 

The employer-employee relationship will continue to evolve as companies shift out of their role as providers to become enablers. In this new era, workers will take a &quot;build your own career&quot; approach establishing greater responsibility and control over their work life.

Updated Expense Policy for 2014
MBO constantly monitors changes to IRS-allowable tax deductions. We periodically incorporate them into our own expense policy so you don&apos;t have to worry about IRS guidelines and can reap the benefits of submitting out-of-pocket expenses!   

In an effort to provide Associates with the best possible expense process while adhering to IRS requirements, MBO Partners has made updates to our Expense Policy in 2014. We are pleased to provide our updated MBO Expense Policy to you now. Please review the policy  &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Expense_Policy.pdf&gt;for full details.  

At any time you can also access this document under the Resources tab of your Business Center. The updated policy is effective as of January 1, 2014. If you have any questions about the policy or changes, please contact your Business Manager.
The Affordable Care Act: What Independent Consultants Need to Know
In MBO Partners&apos; annual State of Independence in America Report &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/index.html&gt;, 37% (down from 45% in 2011) cited concerns about benefits as a challenge to working independently.  Access to benefits has long been a top concern of independent professionals, and for some played a key role in their decision or timing to pursue an independent career. 
Last month, MBO hosted a webinar entitled &quot;The Affordable Care Act: What Independents Need to Know.&quot;  You can view that webinar here &lt;http://video.mbopartners.com/players/38FVT5SY-mMm4x1IW.html?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRolv67JZKXonjHpfsX54%2BotX6W2lMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4DRMJjI%2BSLDwEYGJlv6SgFTLjNMa5w17gIWRQ%3D&gt;, or download the ACA guide &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Affordable_Care_Act_Guide.pdf?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRolv63BZKXonjHpfsX%2F6%2B8kX7Hr08Yy0EZ5VunJEUWy2oQHStQ%2FcOedCQkZHblFnVoAQq27TK0Nr6cI&gt; created with Independents in mind.

CEO CORNER
Taking Back the Term &quot;Self-Employed&quot;
Maybe you&apos;ve heard this joke before: &quot;self-employed&quot; as a euphemism for &quot;out of work,&quot; made famous by the film The Big Lebowski. 
To a serious consultant, that may seem funny on the surface, but in an LA Times article I recently read, the humor can evaporate quickly when applying for a mortgage.The article tells a story about government lenders who equate “self-employed” with “inconsistent income.” More&gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/CEOCornerJanuary14.html&gt;
