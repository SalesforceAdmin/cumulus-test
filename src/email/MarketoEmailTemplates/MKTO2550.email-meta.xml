    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Contact}},

We have identified you as qualified to participate in an important new study &lt;http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe351672746c077f771476&amp;ls=fdeb1c7172650c7b7c157670&amp;m=fef91275706402&amp;l=fecc1c767464067f&amp;s=fe1f1c747362017f761377&amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;t=&gt; because of your industry experience.

Economic conditions and new technologies have resulted in flexible workforces that can meet the fluctuating demands of modern enterprise organizations. The industry-leading market research firm Aberdeen Group is conducting an important study to uncover the strategies, challenges, and capabilities of companies in their management of independent professionals.

 Madeline Laurano, a Research Director at Aberdeen Group, has created this short survey &lt;http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe351672746c077f771476&amp;ls=fdeb1c7172650c7b7c157670&amp;m=fef91275706402&amp;l=fecc1c767464067f&amp;s=fe1f1c747362017f761377&amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;t=&gt; to compile data that will help companies like yours better manage independent professionals. In appreciation for your time, we will provide you with a complimentary copy of the study when it is published in May 2013. 
 
 We look forward to hearing from you and greatly appreciate your time. 

Sincerely,

Jay Lash
