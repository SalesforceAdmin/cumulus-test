And, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thanks again, and I look forward to working with you.   Best regards,Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: Urgently required VOIP Engineer, NYC If I&apos;m going to NYC I would bill thru MBO Partners (mbopartners.com). From your POV i&apos;d be independent by they have all insurances and such, and I get a nice ADP check with all the taxes done, but I can expense my living there.  I can go for 70/hr if it&apos;s in Manhattan. I&apos;m not sure about the other boroughs. DouglasOn Wed, May 16, 2012 at 3:22 PM, Mark &lt;mark@compworldwide.com &lt;http://mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Douglas, So are you independent or having an employer because I need your rate confirmation. Thanks &amp; Regards,Mark
