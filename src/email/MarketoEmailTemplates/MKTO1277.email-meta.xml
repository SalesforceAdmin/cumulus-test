FEATURE ARTICLE
If you’re considering becoming an independent consultant, you should ensure that your personality matches your chosen career path. Below, we’ve compiled six specific personality traits that independent consultants should have or develop to ensure success.
#1 Confident
A successful consultant has the ability to look at a challenge with excitement rather than apprehension – the word “can’t” rarely comes up in a successful consultant’s vernacular.  Their can-do attitude stems from the fact that most successful consultants are extremely confident in their abilities, even when it comes to large or difficult projects.
#2 Realistic
Confidence to tackle difficult projects must also be accompanied by a realistic sense of what is actually possible. Successful consultants can offer clients realistic timelines for completion of work – even if that timeline is contrary to what the client would like to hear. If you try to squeeze a week’s worth of work into two days, odds are you’ll end up disappointing the client with poor-quality work or an extended deadline.
ONE WOMAN&apos;S STORY: INDEPENDENCE AS A LIFESTYLE CHOICE

This month, we feature Consultant Services Advisor Nicolette Taylor, sharing the story of one of her recent conversations.

“I recently helped a senior proposal manager who had spent most of her career in corporate America, but was frankly just sick of the grind and politics. She had spent time as an independent earlier in her career, but most recently reached out to MBO when she received a contract opportunity after losing her full time role working for a large employer.&quot; Read More  &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/one-womans-story-independence-lifestyle-choice&gt;

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. How much is the cost for MBO Partners and is there an obligation to use the services?
A. When you engage with MBO Partners, there are no fees or charges on the front end or back end. If you are accepted to the program, we simply charge a percentage of the total amount received from your clients, and we are paid only when you are.  There are also no obligations or commitments to use MBO.  Use us for as long as you enjoy our services and find value.  We charge 5% of the total amount that is received from your clients (pre-tax of course), and then that fee drops to 1.5% for every dollar after $125,000 in billings every anniversary year. You may choose to run projects for a single or multiple clients through MBO. The choice remains with you.
