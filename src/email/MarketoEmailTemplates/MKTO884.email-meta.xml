Hi Sara-
I did find the webinar useful and really liked the checklist. I tend to consult when I&apos;m in-between permanent positions. However, given now 3 layoffs in 3 years, I&apos;m wondering if I should just launch my own thing.  I&apos;m in contracts management and have a number of small clients who can&apos;t afford in-house resources like me.  My current employer is one of them hence the layoff but they want me to come back and consult.  
 
My challenges are capital (having enough savings to sustain no revenue) and finding more clients.  I also could use some help in walking through the calculator on MBO&apos;s website to determine what hourly rate I should be charging.  I have to be competitive with law firms rated which I can be as a solo practitioner.  I am a JD and will be sitting for the CA bar end of Feb. Once I pass the bar, I cannot practice law here but can provide contracts/business advice with legal knowledge  so my rates need to be lower than an attorney here in VA.   However, when calculating things like how much time I have to take to do business development, marketing, administration, plus other costs like insurance (which I guesstimated), etc., the hourly rate that I should be charging is way too high. 
 
Perhaps we can take some time next week to talk?  
 
Thanks!
Sandy

Count me in, Steve!  Things have changed for me in the employment front and am seriously contemplating launching my own practice.  So this webinar invite could not have come at a better time!
 
Thanks!
