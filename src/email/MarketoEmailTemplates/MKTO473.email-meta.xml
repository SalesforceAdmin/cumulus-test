Dear Kavya,
Its been some time since we last spoke, but I appreciate your interest in working with MBO Partners, and wanted to check in and share some news with you.
We recently launched a new Web site with a set of powerful tools built-in to help those assessing and getting ready for independent work to find their right fit. 
I wanted to share these tools with you personally, and encourage you to take a quick look.
Perhaps you are happily independent now, and have found a solution to manage your business life -- or you may have returned to working full time, or perhaps be in the midst of a search.
Whatever your work life stage, I hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independence in America has arrived, with a  workforce 16 million strong, and predicted to grow to more than 20 million by 2013. Our company well into a year-long journey to better understand and celebrate independent work in our nation, called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view the site&apos;s very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.
I do hope you will take time to learn if MBO Partners is right for you or not. Please stay in touch and let me know how I can help further your career. Parting thought: do you already know that number-one challenge or opportunity I can help you with?
Steve Arhancet
