    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=future associate}},

I wanted to touch base as a courtesy and see how the contract search is going.

We have a number of resources on our site that we continually update, you can find them here: http://www.mbopartners.com/resources.Â  In addition, if you have any suggestions for new resources that might help other consultants - please let us know!

Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

{{lead.Lead Owner First Name:default=Steve}}
