Thanks for your response.  I’ve enclosed a brochure about the MBO Partners Security Clearance Process.  In short, we take care of everything up to TS, the SCI portion (if you have it), is held at the agency.  
 
I’ll be at the ready when something comes through.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.
 
Steve

Steve,
 
Thanks again for the below information.  I have been busy completing my tasks with GDIT and our customer for closeout today.
 
I have cc’d my new rick.lindsay@att.net e-mail address.
 
I have one question about Security Clearances that I don’t remember discussing during our phone call.
How are they handled?  Is it through MBO Partners?
 
Still trying to get that first customer to say I need you for ….
When I do, I will then call and we will set the wheels in motion.

R,
Rick Lindsay
