    <subject>MBO Partners Independent Consulting Brief - November 2012</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
As CEO of MBO Partners, I’ve watched the growth of independent work for more than two decades. A year ago this December, I shared a prediction that by the decade’s end, 1 in 2 members of the U.S. private workforce would be career independent. But I was concerned about the gap in quality educational content and honest, factual guidance for this new workforce. 
That is why I personally sponsored The Independent&apos;s Guide &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide&gt;, a rich online library of free resource guides, articles, templates and downloadable tools to help professionals plan, launch, succeed and grow their independent consultancy career. It already contains more than 35 articles and blogs, as well as 100+ pages of free, downloadable guides, and is constantly updated with fresh content. View it now. &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide&gt;

BUILDING A PERSONAL BRAND, AND WHY IT MATTERS
Whether you’re an independent consultant or a Fortune 100 company, branding is integral to your identity. From your name and logo to your company slogan and reputation, it’s how the public knows you. As an independent consultant, you are your company, and establishing a strong personal brand is essential to the growth and success of your business.
Why it Matters      
Potential clients should never have to search for the basic information that defines your company or business goals. There are three main questions that potential clients will have that your branding should answer:

MORE THAN THE MONEY: A VETERAN CONTRACTOR ENJOYS A FLEXIBLE INDEPENDENT LIFESTYLE

Nicolette Taylor, a consultant services advisor for MBO Partners, shares the story of how an experienced military contractor tested the waters of independence — and liked it enough to take the dive.   

“For the group of independents that have already had successful careers, the money oftentimes isn’t as important to them as the flexibility of being independent. These are people that are secure and stable, but aren’t quite ready to stop working. Many of them find independence suits them well.”

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. How does MBO help me with client contracts?
A. Setting up contracts as an independent consultant is complex, and it’s easy to make mistakes that can cost time and money later. With MBO Partners, your pre-assigned personal Business Manager can help look out for your interests and even work with a client on your behalf to review and redline contract agreements, or help you develop an RFP to work with a government agency. All you need to do is agree to your rate and description of services, and we’ll help with administration from then on. We’re there to help with tricky issues like indemnification, non-competes, governing law, invoicing, and payment terms.

TESTIMONIAL
“MBO&apos;s benefits are great. If you&apos;ve been laid off from a full-time job and want to try your hand at consulting, putting together a good and affordable benefits package is a real challenge. MBO not only makes it easy to get these benefits all in one place, they offer them at very reasonable prices.”
