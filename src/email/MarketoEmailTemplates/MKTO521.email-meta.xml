Hi Steve,
             We went through your website and we have a brief idea of what you are into. A little more info on your vision/plans for mobile applications, would help us suggest what kind of solutions we can provide you.

Our team is currently working on a mobile app for a NGO called ALERT-Emergency Care, which is backed by our government and an e-commerce website Masterkitchen.co.in. These are still in their early stages of development.

We would like to establish our credibility and potential by doing a free of cost Proof Of Concept for any one of your business case. The POC will be a  deploy able mobile application which you can test on various devices.

We will take things further solely based on our performance on the POC.

Looking forward to working with you

Thanks
Sharan

Sharan,
 
Thanks for the reply; and I’m sure we will be here when the project is right for MBO.  
 
We do have some Mobile needs.  Can you please send me some examples of your work, perhaps a short paragraph about your capabilities so that I can send this to my CTO?
 
Thanks,
 
Steve
