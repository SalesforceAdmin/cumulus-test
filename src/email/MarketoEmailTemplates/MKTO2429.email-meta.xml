Subject: RE: MBO Partners Enrollment Information Quick heads up . . . Technically, I’m still married but though going through the last few steps of a divorce, which should be complete in early 2013.  My tax accountant suggests that, for 2013 tax purposes, I should fill out all tax forms as Single (No Dependents). Thought you should know, just in case the topic ever comes up . . . -- Bing  From: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt; [mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;]
