I’ll be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services and answer any specific questions you may have.   Per your questions about your tax situation, our HR team said that as long as you are working in the US and paying US taxes under a US Social Security Number then we can allow you to work under our program.  I will still need to have a conversation with you to explain how the program works to ensure it will be a good fit for you, but we do function similarly to some of the “umbrella” companies you are familiar with. You may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here. You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube. I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners! Nicolette  ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
