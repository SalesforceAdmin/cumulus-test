Thank you for forwarding this to me.  I will review it and then we can have a conversation about specifically you would like to be included in the contract.  Usually a termination clause does the trick but if you have more specific language in mind we can work on it and incorporate it.  It may take me until Monday to fully review and get the approved changes back to BAE but I will do my best to get it done tomorrow if possible.
 
Thank you again and I look forward to speaking to you again soon.
 
Have a great evening,
 
Nicolette

Nicolette,

Here is the draft contract.  I filled in the requested fields and sent it to BAE as well.  What is not included is some escape clause language...is that something you can help me with?

Gary

Gentleman,
Attached please find the standard BAE Systems PSA Agreement and the relevant attachment including a generic SOW for the work that will need to be performed under this contract.
 
At this time we are requesting that you review and fill in the yellow highlighted portions of the documents, then sign and return the documents to me.  In terms of pricing we are looking for a fixed priced labor hour fully burdened rate for the portions of the SOW that you feel your company can perform. Please state the labor category of the person, i.e. Sr Engineer, Fully burdened rate of $110/hr and the section(s) of the SOW that your company can perform.
 
Please review these documents and have your responses back to me by 11/2/11, if you have any questions or concerns please feel free to give me or Randy a call.

Don
