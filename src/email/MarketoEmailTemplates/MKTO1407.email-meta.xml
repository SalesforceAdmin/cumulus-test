Subject: MBO Partners Follow Up   Dear Barbara,  Some time ago you requested information regarding the services offered by MBO Partners.  Now might not be the right time for you.  Whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation. Are you working on a contract/project now or are you currently working W2 at the moment? Regards, Nicolette ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
