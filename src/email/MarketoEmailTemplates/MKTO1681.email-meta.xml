We will be able to back date the time so don’t worry about that aspect. For now, just follow the process you have with IBI.  Once your account is active I will walk you through how to enter time and expense deductions.  Thanks for keeping me updated and in the loop.
Take care,Sara From: Daniel Murphy [mailto:dpmurphy_fl@yahoo.com]

Subject: Hours reporting Sara,

I usually report my hours to IBI each week either Sunday night or Monday morning.

Should I copy you or anyone else at MBO?

Also how and when do I report expenses which will be deducted from my taxable gross income?

I only worked 2.75 hours last week and expect to work 20-20 hours this week.

There is a delay in getting ID&apos;s and permissions to the GM system which limits how much I can do this week.  I suspect next week should be close to the normal 40 hour week.

Thank you,

Dan </textOnly>
