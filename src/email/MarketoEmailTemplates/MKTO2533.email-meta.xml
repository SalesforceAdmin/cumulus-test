At the end, an I-9 will populate; you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.)  I will also need you to send me a copy of your US passport (you can just take a picture with your phone and email that to me.) Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions. This needs to be done ASAP so we can provide your client t with needed security information.
