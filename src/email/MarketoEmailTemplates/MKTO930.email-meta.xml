It was nice to briefly chat with you. Here is some information on MBO Partners you might find helpful in learning more about the benefits to the workers you refer to us:

The value to your organization by sending workers to us is outlined on our enterprise services page: www.mboenterprise.com
Look forward to chatting with you when you have time. You can easily book a time that works for you using my online calendar.
Best regards,
Sara
