Dear Val and Patrick, 
 
On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with you and your organization.  I have reviewed the agreement and enclosed the revised version with our information.  I have included a copy that lists our changes as well as a clean copy should you accept them for your counter signature. 
 
Here are the list of changes and explination for each one:
 
 
Descriptoin of services - Due to our role as an employer or record for tax purposes and not that of a staffing agency we can not attest to the level of skill.  
Term - We prefer 60 days written notice from IFAW.  
·         Fee -  The fee is $75 per hour at 35 hours per week. Thus, the budget was updated to reflect this.
 
If you are curious about MBO Partners and what we do and how we work, we have a short one page overview that may answer some of your questions, which you may access by going here.
I look forward to working with you,  
 
Best regards,
 
Sara

Jake,
 
I want to introduce you to Sara Conde.  I am going to be out of the office the next few days and then going on another business trip and I won’t be able to provide you the service levels you should be getting from MBO.  Sara is by far one of the best Consultant Services Advisors we have, you’re in great hands.  I’ve gotten her up to speed and she looks forward to working with you and will be in touch soon.
 
Steve

Dear Val and Patrick,
The reason why I requested an electronic version of the contract to review was because I wanted to review it and introduce you to Steve Arhancet at MBO Partners.  MBO Partners handles tax, expense, benefit, payment and contract management for independent consultants.  Steve is my contact at MBO Partners that manages my various contracts.  I wanted to send a brief introduction as a couple changes in the contract will be needed.  His information is below and will be following up shortly.  If interested more information can be found at www.mbopartners.com 

Thanks,
Jake
