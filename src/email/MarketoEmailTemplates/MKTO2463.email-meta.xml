    <textOnly>Are quarterly estimated tax filings a source of stress for your independent business?
MBO Partners manages your business expenses so you get the immediate tax benefit each time you draw a paycheck. You pay taxes on your net earnings as you pay yourself, rather than estimating quarterlies. 
That means no more &quot;shoe box&quot; of receipts to go through every time you file, a lower audit risk for your return and more money in your pocket.
You can learn more about how MBO works here &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/how-mbo-works&gt;.
