Independent professionals want work, and enterprises need expert help. Why can&apos;t they find each other?

To answer this question, MBO Partners is partnering with Work Market, an online platform businesses use to find and hire self-employed workers. The result will be the future of how independents find their contracts.

Check out our press release &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-and-work-market-announce-partnership-revolutionize-enterprise-independent-contractor&gt; or email me to learn more.
