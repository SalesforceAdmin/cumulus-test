Subject: Landing the Big One article Sara, I enjoyed your article on independents doing business with Fortune 500 companies. I think MBO offers a great service. I&apos;ve been following your company for a few years, although I haven&apos;t had a chance to do business with MBO yet. I noticed that you are based in Northern Virginia. I do most of my data networking consulting work in the Dulles Corridor. I&apos;m curious about your insight into outside staffing needs for the big companies. When you help an independent contractor land business, do you ever hear back from him or her that additional people are needed for a project? The reason I ask is that I&apos;d like to work with MBO. I understand the &quot;bring your own business&quot; model that you mention in the article. I&apos;m wondering if the existing relationships that MBO has with top companies yields information that positions your company to do additional business, perhaps creating a need to draw in other ICs in MBO&apos;s network. Jeff L. --Jeff Loughridge
