We do have a list of approved notaries here &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/notaries&gt; if you need help knowing where to go.  Please let me know if you have any questions while Nicolette is out.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; If you are in the DC area please check out our upcoming networking event! &lt;http://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/event?oeidk=a07e6cqaqtk0702919f&amp;llr=kp5x6qkab&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: FW:I told the notary that she needed to sign in as in the example.  She said that because it is not for Arizona she&apos;s required to sign on the stamp.  (Didn&apos;t make sense to me, but she insisted.)  She refused to sign again where I requested. I&apos;ll try another notary tomorrow. Lyn In a message dated 9/20/2012 3:13:12 P.M.
