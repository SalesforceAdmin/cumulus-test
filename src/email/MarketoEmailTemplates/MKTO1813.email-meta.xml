Your account will remain in “parked” status (just in case you would like to use MBO for another project.) You were never active with us so there is no need to close it. Congrats on your new project and take care!Sara From: Sandi Dale [mailto:mail@sandidale.com]

Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Sandi Dale Hi Sara,
I was trying to figure out how to delete my MBO account last week. I am working now and couldn&apos;t use MBO services. IBM brought me back on the project as a contractor, but they made me use one of their preferred vendors. I tried to convince them to use MBO, but they would not. So I won&apos;t be using MBO, at least not now.

Thank you for all your help. Will you please delete my online account?

Hello Sandi,
I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?
Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
	- There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one:

	- MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, there’s real hard facts about The State of Independence in America &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPXByb2QtbC0yOTcmbWVzc2FnZWlkPTI5NyZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEzMzQ4ODg3ODImc2VyaWFsPTEyNjQ4OTI2MDImZW1haWxpZD1tYWlsQHNhbmRpZGFsZS5jb20mdXNlcmlkPWwtMTI4LTExNzk3LTk0NDEzJmV4dHJhPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;http://info.mbopartners.com/stateofindependence?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvKjNZKXonjHpfsXx7%2BgsWrHr08Yy0EZ5VunJEUWy2YEDRdQhcOuuEwcWGog8zQ5X&gt; that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent. 

Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.
