    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued MBO Associate}}, 

 I am very pleased to share some exciting news with you! Announced in a recent press release, http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120619006336/en/MBO-Partners-Launches-Private-Social-Business-Platform, MBO Partners launched a new, free online networking platform called MBO Access. You are cordially invited to participate in this exclusive community.

MBO Access will serve as a platform for you to build a rich profile, connect with fellow Associates, Alumni, and MBO Clients. In addition, you will find rich resources, special promotions and information leading to potential new projects and various opportunities – targeted to your specific industries and geographical locations.

As a result of the MBO Access launch, we have decided to discontinue the “Connection Center” in your Business Center, as well as the published web site you may have opted to create. If you have one wish to keep your individual site alive, please notify us by responding to this email by 7/27/2012. Otherwise, your web site will be deleted. 

How can I get started with MBO Access?
In an effort to get you quickly acclimated with MBO Access, we have created a 3 minute video tutorial, http://www.mbopartners.com/spages/acctutorial/acctutorial.html, to help you get started. Of course, please feel free to contact me directly for a personalized walk through of the new system if that is your preference. Your username for MBO Access will be the same as your MBO Business Center, and the very first time you login, you will need to click “Forgot your password,” to generate a password for you.

Visit http://www.mbopartners.com/access to login to MBO Access today!

I encourage you to log in asap, build up your profile and connect with me! I look forward to discussing the site with you, and welcome any feedback. 

Best Regards,
