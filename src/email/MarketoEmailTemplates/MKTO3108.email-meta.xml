I wanted to thank you for completing the MBO Partners Introductory Survey. Because your responses indicate that you operate as an independent business, we must now determine if you meet SAE’s International’s criteria for operating as a sub-contracted vendor as you work on your project.   Action Required: Please complete this Qualification Questionnaire &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/redirect/cqq.html&gt;. We recommend setting aside about 30 minutes.   What Comes Next: Once you’ve completed the questionnaire, MBO will contact you to discuss your responses, determine next steps (which may include submitting supporting documentation), and prepare you for enrollment. If you do not appear to meet SAE’s vendor criteria, don’t worry. We may be able to work together to bring your qualification status up to SAE’s required levels. And even if we can’t, you’ll still be able to proceed with your project through our “MBO Exec” engagement service. Congratulations again on your assignment and we look forward to working with you!  Best regards, ___________________Meghan MoulConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6359f: 703.793.6473e: mmoul@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:mmoul@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
