Subject: Re: MBO Partners Hi Sara,
Thanks for your note- I&apos;ve looked over the services offered and right now it&apos;s just too early.  Meaning for me, the contracts and rates and billing stuff I&apos;m all totally fine with- I did exactly this gig working for a larger group and have done all those things and very comfortable and an efficient system for me.

Where I may need insights are on the (future not current) company structure, but that won&apos;t be till the end of the year and can&apos;t anticipate now as they may or may not involve others.  Also, I have good legal help and a relationship there, so my questions would be more to accounting/tax treatments (again later in the year).

If you can make a tickler to ping me early October, I&apos;ll just be better able to engage and go over where I&apos;m at with things...    Much thanks, ChrisOn Mon, May 21, 2012 at 6:09 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com&gt; wrote:Dear Chris,  Hello, my name is Sara Conde, a Consultant Services Advisor with MBO Partners.  I received your contact information from James Hering.  James has enjoyed our program and thought it would be worthwhile for us to discuss MBO Services to see if it is something that you might find valuable.  You can schedule a convenient time by using my online calendar. I look forward to speaking with you, Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
