    <subject>UPDATED: Contractor Engagement Quarterly - Q1 2013</subject>
    <textOnly>Q1 FOCUS: NEW ENTERPRISE WEBINAR SERIES 
2013 is off to a fast start at MBO Partners - Enterprise Solutions. Our clients are predicting increased use of consultants and we are gearing up for new enterprise program implementations to kick off in the first quarter.

But as the independent workforce movement grows, so do the complications. That&apos;s why this quarter&apos;s focus is “Client Readiness” – or determining if businesses are prepared to tackle an enterprise IC engagement program. To headline this initiative, we have created a webinar series &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/EnterpriseSeriesSign-up_RegistrationPage.html&gt; designed to educate and prepare you for the changing workforce. Register for the first webinar today &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/Feb19Webinar-ClientReadiness_RegistrationPage.html&gt; and join us as we navigate the project economy.

TESTIMONIAL
&quot;In a recent review of our Contingent and Freelance Labor Program, involving stakeholders in HR, Procurement, Legal and the Brand CFOs,  the following comments were directed toward the MBO solution at Limited Brands: &apos;Great visibility,&apos; &apos;Sound controls,&apos; &apos;Reduced IC misclassification risk,&apos; &apos;Spend being properly managed,&apos; &apos;Little noise,&apos; and &apos;More informed then we have ever been.&apos; Each of MBO&apos;s respective teams, as well as their combined partnership, has played major roles in our results over the past 9 months. We would not be where we are without the dedication, knowledge, and patience of MBO.&quot;

The IC Engagement Environment: Untangling Evolving Relationships
Those of us in the independent contractor engagement and services business have a significant challenge to contend with. As we scramble to implement the best possible IC engagement programs – often tweaking, blowing up, and recreating processes along the way – it’s easy to forget that we’re all still in the formative stages of a burgeoning industry.

Since the passage of health care reform legislation in 2010, one of the key questions has been how it will impact employers. On December 28, 2012, the last Friday of the calendar year, the IRS released proposed regulations regarding the Affordable Care Act and employer “shared responsibility,” sometimes referred to as “pay or play.”

FEATURED INDEPENDENT
Kirk Ward began consulting in 1996, but after the technology bust in 2001, he was moved to part-time because his company had to cut back.
