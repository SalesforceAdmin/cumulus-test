    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Client Contact}},

Join us Tuesday, June 25, at 1:00 p.m. ET for the third webinar in our Independent Contractor Compliance and Engagement 2013 series: Compliance Officer Training: The Refresher Course on IC Qualification &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/Jun25Webinar-Compliance.html&gt;. &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/Feb19Webinar-ClientReadiness_RegistrationPage.html&gt;

During this hour-long webinar, Jay Lash, VP of Market Strategies at MBO Partners - Enterprise Solutions, will cover the the criteria and the rationale for meeting qualifications for IC determination at most major enterprise organizations. 

Lash will be joined by two guests: Lonnie Goldman, an experienced General Counsel for Silicon Valley start-up organizations and Dave Cassar, MBO Partners VP of Operations who directs the Vendor Assessment Service Team  (VAST) at MBO. This presentation will also be a useful refresher to help industry veterans stay on top of the latest rulings and changing regulations, as well as a valuable resource for any stakeholder making decisions for their organizationâ€™s IC engagement.
