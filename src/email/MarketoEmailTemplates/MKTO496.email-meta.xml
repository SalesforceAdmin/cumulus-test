I enjoyed our conversation as well!  It was a pleasure learning a little bit about you and I look forward to having the opportunity to work with you in the near future.  If you ever have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out to me.  I will forward your information to my Associate that works with Accenture to see if she can be of any assistance on getting a contact person for you to reach out to.
 
Have a great day and a very happy holiday if I do not speak with you before then!
 
Nicolette

Dear Nicolette: 
 
I thoroughly enjoyed our telephone discussion this afternoon and the excellent, and informative information that you provided during our telephone discussions.  Accordingly, I am certainly impressed with the business operations and professional services provided by MBO Partners, and undoubtedly I sincerely believe that MBO Partners would provide the precise and most professional services required by my consulting practice.  I will certainly send you a copy of my professional profile and the technology commercialization position from Accenture tomorrow.  Thank you very much, and please call me or send me an e-mail should you have any questions or other concerns.
 
Arthur
