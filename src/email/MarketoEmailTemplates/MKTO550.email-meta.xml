Thank you for the inquiry you submitted at the MBO Partners website.  I wanted to introduce myself as the person at MBO Partners responsible for all new associate and partnership requests. I’ll be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services or answer any specific questions you may have.  Unfortunately I will not have any time today to speak, but you may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here: https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK and I will follow up with you then.
 
You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube: http://youtu.be/zKDzwSTmGv4. 
 
I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners!
 
Thank you and have a great day,
Nicolette
