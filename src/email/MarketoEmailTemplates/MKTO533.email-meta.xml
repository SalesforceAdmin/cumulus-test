Hi Steve,
It does not seem like it has been  6 months.
Believe it or not this project is still being considered and has moved to another level.
I am also looking a possible second project.  
I would be interested in touching base with you for a few minutes tomorrow.
I have a meeting on Wednesday and have a few questions for you.
Do you have time for a phone call on Tuesday 12/19.  My schedule is fairly flexible.
 
Let me know.
 
Thanks,
Dave Feller

Hi Steve,
 
Thanks for the followup.  The project we discussed is still under review for approval.  I would give about a 50/50 chance of going through in it&apos;s current form.  If this funding source does not go through there are secondary sources being considered.   i do have some additional questions.  However, I want to wait for the project to advance before we spend more time.  I will keep you informed.  
 
Thank you for taking the time to clarify your services.  It has been helpful in formulating the best approach to this project.  
 
Regards, 
 
Dave.
