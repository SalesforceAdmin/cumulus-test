Each project payment agreement will be managed as an addendum to this agreement.&quot;  Instead, I would like your suggestion of alternate wording that would tie them to MBO partners.   I think that adequate wording might be: &quot;James Jin would receive payment on an individual client project basis by enrolling with MBO Partners as an independent consultant for payment to be agreed upon separately in each project instance.  Each project payment agreement will be managed by MBO Partners as a client of GSA.   For general information, see Annex A.&quot; Annex A would be the attached MBO document.  In addition, please see the attached Non-Disclosure Agreement, which I would like each to sign for my own protection.  However, as these personnel are actually your employees, I need to know how these documents relate to your own company&apos;s liability.   One way this non-disclosure document differs from the other is that it doesn&apos;t specify which State the law falls under.  Perhaps it should?   I used Rocket Lawyer to generate both of these, and will also have foreign employees, notably in China sign them.  Those people of course don&apos;t come under MBO, but how do I manage this issue regarding those that do?   Please advise.  Thank you! Walter
