Steve,
 
Really, thanks so much for the reach back. With the passing of the big holiday rush in November and supporting a slew of high interest projects, everything kind of fell off the radar. Thank you for contacting me back. In short, YES I am still very interesting in chatting. I will open up your calendar to book a time later tonight (after I get off of client site). I briefly looked at the new page and it looks very interesting, I&apos;ll have to take a closer look when I get home tonight.
 
Anyway, again, thank you so much for pinging me back. I would have continued in this existence (job) all throughout the holidays, with my dreams of being independant completely forgotten, had you not emailed me back.
 
 
Thank you,
James

James,
 
Wanted to send off another email and see if you were still interested in chatting about the services provided by MBO Partners.   We just came out with a pretty cool page that highlights some of the people who use our program.  You can go here to take a look:

Any update would be great.
