Welcome back to MBO Partners!  
 
Here are some important reminders to be aware of:
 
Here are some time and expense entry instructions for using our system.Here is a copy of our expense policy.Here is a list of the most common expenses you can submit to MBO. 
The next step is to schedule another time  that works for you so we can do a walk-through of the business center and I can show you all the great features.
 
I look forward to working with you!
