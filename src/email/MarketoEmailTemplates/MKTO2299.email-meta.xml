All the expenses have been approved aside from the two gifts: Expenses in Question: ·         12/19/2012: Gift Expense: More Than One = $11.59·         12/19/2012: Gift Expense: Hickory Farms = $144.00  If we bill these through MBO they will be treated as taxable income because MBO does not MBO does not reimburse the purchase of gifts on behalf of your client. This is listed on page 18 of our expense policy &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Expense_Policy.pdf&gt;.  Would you like me to go ahead and bill these expenses knowing they will be treated as income or would you prefer to ask the client to reimburse you separately and leave t hem outside of the MBO system? Please let me know ASAP. Thanks,
Sara  ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject: RE: Time and expenses Hi, Sara.I just finished entering my time for Dec 12th thru Jan 11th.  I also have entered my expenses and receipts into the system so they can be sent as one invoice (at least this time).  The accounting department at MBO Partners will see all of my receipt PDF’s uploaded with the first expense listed.  I have also attached them here as well. If you have any questions, let me know. Thanks. Larry Brown(404) 626-7530 From: Sara Conde [mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;]
