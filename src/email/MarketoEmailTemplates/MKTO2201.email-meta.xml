Subject: Re: Thank You for Your Interest in MBO Partners Hello Nicolette, I am recently presented a six month contract opportunity for a W2 rate of $75/hour or corp-to-corp rate of $80/hour by a recruiter. I searched and found your website recommended on an Internet forum. I would like to know your service fees to ensure it make sense going with corp-to-corp rate using your service, versus accepting the W2 rate. I would also like to know how your service works and how long it takes to setup. Thank you!Cheers,Oliver Triunfo
