I believe 8(a) is for any minority owned company here are the requirements &lt;http://www.sba.gov/content/8a-requirements-overview&gt; according to SBA. To be honest, MBO would like to connect IC’s with our clients but we are not quite there yet. There are several ideas in the planning stages but none of them are active right now.  Yes, MBO is only paid when you are paid. There are no other fees. My radio show is an indie rock radio show www.thecasoshow.com &lt;http://www.thecasoshow.com&gt;. I love radio, I was a DJ in college and have kept it up as a hobby– it’s so much fun! Thanks Simmie,Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject: RE: MBO Partenrs and Disadvantage Status Sara, So far, the weekend is looking pretty well.  However, the rain is tentatively due to hit later on Sunday.  No worries! Thank you for the status update on 8(a) (or other disadvantaged status) and MBO Partners.I am a VA certified SDVOSB.  I am not sure that I would qualify to be eligible for an 8(a) certification, as I believe it is a certification for African American and American Indian owned companies.  Please advise me on your thoughts on this subject. On a tangent, I understand that MBO Partners provides the back office support for Independent Consultants (ICs) and MBO Partners do not make any recommendations to clients regarding any particular company, associated with MBO Partners.  However, listening to Gene talk the other day, it does sound like MBO Partners attempts to connect ICs with clients, who have a need for their services.  Additionally, MBO Partners only charges for their services once an associated IC company has a contract and is actually earning money.  Is my view of MBO Partners accurate?   On another tangent, what is the focus of your radio show?   Simmie   Dr. Simmie A.

Subject: MBO Partenrs and Disadvantage Status Hi Simmie, I hope you are doing well. I did follow up with Gene regarding how we would work with a disadvantaged status through MBO and I wanted to give you the highlights: o    In order to apply for 8(a) (or other disadvantaged status) you need to have 2 years of documented experience running your own company when you approach the SBA.  o    If you can prove that you have had experience running  your own business without having a legal entity (i.e. running a division within a large company, using a firm like MBO etc.) there is a wavier that you can submit to SBA for their review.  o    MBO is currently working with SBA and applying for a waiver like this for our Associates.   o    The status of our application is TBD.  o    If it is accepted our Associates will be able to use their MBO billing and payment history to win the 8(a) status.  o    If our Associates are granted that status they would move their MBO costumers under their own business entity as that would be the firm that holds 8(a) (not MBO).   This is the latest info, let me know if you would like to discuss via phone. Have a great weekend,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9c2ltbWllLmFkYW1zQGNzcC1sbGMub3JnJnVpZD0wJmV4dHJhPU1USTNmSE55WTJsa1BUTTBNSHh0WVdsc2FXUTlaalprWkdKbE9USXRaamswT0MwME5XVTRMVGs0TURRdE1qTmxaRFkzTkRVME5XTTVMVE0wTUh4bWNtOXRQWE5qYjI1a1pVQnRZbTl3WVhKMGJtVnljeTVqYjIxOGMzVmlhajFOUWs4Z1VHRnlkR1Z1Y25NZ1lXNWtJRVJwYzJGa2RtRnVkR0ZuWlNCVGRHRjBkWE09PSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCaFhUuE5zpf2dI6T%2BvzbTatWkt78zBuXhuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9c2ltbWllLmFkYW1zQGNzcC1sbGMub3JnJnVpZD0wJmV4dHJhPU1USTNmSE55WTJsa1BUTTBNSHh0WVdsc2FXUTlaalprWkdKbE9USXRaamswT0MwME5XVTRMVGs0TURRdE1qTmxaRFkzTkRVME5XTTVMVE0wTUh4bWNtOXRQWE5qYjI1a1pVQnRZbTl3WVhKMGJtVnljeTVqYjIxOGMzVmlhajFOUWs4Z1VHRnlkR1Z1Y25NZ1lXNWtJRVJwYzJGa2RtRnVkR0ZuWlNCVGRHRjBkWE09PSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.mbopartners.com/?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCaFhUuE5zpf2dI6T%2BvzbTatWkt78zBuXhuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9c2ltbWllLmFkYW1zQGNzcC1sbGMub3JnJnVpZD0wJmV4dHJhPU1USTNmSE55WTJsa1BUTTBNSHh0WVdsc2FXUTlaalprWkdKbE9USXRaamswT0MwME5XVTRMVGs0TURRdE1qTmxaRFkzTkRVME5XTTVMVE0wTUh4bWNtOXRQWE5qYjI1a1pVQnRZbTl3WVhKMGJtVnljeTVqYjIxOGMzVmlhajFOUWs4Z1VHRnlkR1Z1Y25NZ1lXNWtJRVJwYzJGa2RtRnVkR0ZuWlNCVGRHRjBkWE09PSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&amp;mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCaFhUuE5zpf2dI6T%2BvzbTatWkt78zBuXhuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&gt; to MBO Partners!
