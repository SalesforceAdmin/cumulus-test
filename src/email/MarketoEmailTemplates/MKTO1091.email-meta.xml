Subject: RE: Getting Started with MBO! Heather, It has been quite some time since we last communicated.  Paul Shahady recently contacted me about working on a new program.  That program has to be competed so it is not certain at this time.  Paul suggested I finish negotiating with SES LLC and MBO Partners so that my bio is on the SES LLC website and my paperwork is in order.  How do I proceed? Don Hanson From: Heather Rocco [ &lt;mailto:hrocco@mbopartners.com&quot;&gt;mailto:hrocco@mbopartners.com&lt;span style=&apos;mso-bookmark:_MailOriginal&gt;]

Subject: RE: Getting Started with MBO! Hi Don, I hit send too early!   If you have a client you want to run through MBO for some consulting work you would simply mention that MBO Partners will be the vendor you will be using to provide back office support during the contract (i.e. invoicing, payroll processing, contract administration).  If it is easier you can also have them reach out to me directly and I can get the contract in place on your behalf. Sincerely,Heather  Heather K.

Subject: RE: Getting Started with MBO! Heather, Attached is my signed copy of the S&amp;T Talent Team Agreement.  If I understand correctly, an Attachment A is only required when Senior Executive Services, LLC has found me a client or vice versa.  Is that correct?   If the company that has expressed an interest in me consulting for them wants to submit a proposal how should it be addressed? Don From: Heather Rocco [ &lt;mailto:hrocco@mbopartners.com&quot;&gt;mailto:hrocco@mbopartners.com&lt;span style=&apos;mso-bookmark:_MailOriginal&gt;]

Subject: Getting Started with MBO! Hi Don, It was a pleasure speaking with you today!  To review, consultants seek out our service as an alternative to self incorporating with the back-office support, tax advantages, and benefits of a W-2 employer -- without limiting your career independence. MBO will set up your contract and engage you in our MBO Executive program.  As you work we&apos;ll bill your clients, collect your billings, withhold taxes, give access to excellent group benefits, and reimburse your business expenses. We even cover you under our General and Professional Liability insurance at no cost to you.  And using MBO couldn&apos;t be easier: all you&apos;ll have to do is submit your time and expenses through your personal online &quot;Business Center&quot; as you work and we will pay you. I have attached more detailed information on MBO, including a list of allowable business expenses, and some associate testimonials. You may also find more information about our insurance benefits at  &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/b/benefits2010&quot;&gt;www.mbopartners.com/b/benefits2010. I will send a follow up email with a link to begin enrollment and start using our services. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks!Heather You can also connect with the MBO Partners community on YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn&lt;span style=&apos;mso-bookmark:_MailOriginal&gt;.  Heather K.
