Yes, I am available this PM. I am not sure why you received a general voicemail box, that is strange. Did you dial my direct line? Unfortunately, I do not have skype at the office but it’s certainly something I could look into for our future conversations.
 
What time should I expect your call or would you prefer I reach out to you directly?
 
Thanks Jake!

Are you available this pm?  I tried you this morning but got a general voicemail box for some reason.  If you’re able to skype that would be ideal for me.</textOnly>
