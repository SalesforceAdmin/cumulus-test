Sounds good.  As a reminder the notary just needs to sign in section 2, a full ‘notarization’ is not necessary.  If they notarize it that is fine, but its not required.

Steve,
 
Sorry to take so long on this. I&apos;ve been busy working, which is a good thing. I expect to get the I9 form notarized tomorrow (Saturday).

Steve,
 
I called you and left a message earlier this afternoon. My associate id is 1327. I&apos;d like to become active with MBO Partners through a new contract with Watsontown Trucking Company in Milton, PA. The contact is the owner of the company, Steve Patton. He can be reached preferably on his mobile phone at 570-594-4791 or at his desk at 570-522-1240. He is expecting a call from MBO Partners. The arrangement is for me to be paid bi-weekly. The billing rate is $55.00 an hour. I&apos;ll be working around 40-45 hours a week. The project length could be 3-6 months initially and possibly go on indefinitely. My start date is Tuesday January 3, 2012. I&apos;d also like to get started in the group health benefits.
