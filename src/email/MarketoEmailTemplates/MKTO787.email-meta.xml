You are very welcome!  
 
The work agreement you sent me would be something that you would sign since it references more the scope of work you are to be providing to the client.  There would need to be some separate agreement, either our MSA or the clients but I will need to have a conversation with them to get more details on who the relationship would exist between (Hawker Beechcraft Defense Company or SNC).  I will let you know when I have heard from Bill and how that conversation goes and we will take it from there.
 
Thank you and have a great day,
 
Nicolette

Nicolette, thanks for the call this afternoon.  You&apos;re very helpful.

I&apos;ve attached the draft work agreement.  Question:  When the work agreement is finalized, do I sign it or does MBO sign it?

Here is a more detailed description of the statement of work:
PHASE I:  REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD AND PROVIDE AFFIDAVITS IN SUPPORT OF SNC’S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AND IN OPPOSITION TO HBDC’S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT
 
1.  Review and analyze the Air Force administrative record submitted to the United States Court of Federal Claims.
2.  Review and analyze HBDC’s Motion for Judgment Upon Administrative Record (due February 7, 2012)
3.  Consult with SNC’s outside counsel concerning SNC’s opposition to HSDC’s Motion for Judgment Upon Administrative Record and/or in support of SNC’s Motion for Judgment Upon Administrative Record (due February 21, 2012)
4.  Prepare and execute necessary Affidavit(s) in connection with the foregoing.
 
PHASE II:  IF MATTER PROCEEDS TO TRIAL
 
1.  Prepare for and provide expert deposition testimony.
2.  Consult with SNC’s outside counsel in connection with depositions of HBDC’s fact and expert witnesses.
3.  Prepare and provide testimony at trial.
