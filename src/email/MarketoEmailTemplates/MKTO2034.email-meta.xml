In terms of the agreement the client can use this SOW &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_SOW.pdf&gt; along with (or without) our MSA &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_MSA_Template.pdf&gt;. Or if they would like something less formal they can use the attached letter agreement (may be the most appropriate for this case.) I have also attached our W-9, sample insurance certificate, and billing and payment instructions for their records. 
If they want to move forward with the letter agreement please have them sign and return to me via email and I will return fully executed copy.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; If you are in the DC area please check out our upcoming networking event! &lt;http://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/event?oeidk=a07e6cqaqtk0702919f&amp;llr=kp5x6qkab&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: Insurance question Hi Sara,
Thanks for chatting with Janet.  Attached is my I9.  I emailed it to doc@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:doc@mbopartners.com&gt; last night @ 8:02.

I talked with my supervisor at LegalShield today.  They would like some kind of statement of work, so I&apos;ll look over the MBO samples and see if anything fits rather than go without a written agreement.

The business information is:
	- LegalShield	- Web development	- Ongoing development of Java based applications	- One Pre-Paid Way, Ada, Oklahoma 74820	- $100/hr	- Weekly billing	- Due upon receipt	- Duane Smith - duanesmith@pplsi.com &lt;mailto:duanesmith@pplsi.com&gt;

Thanks!

Subject: Insurance question Hi Sara,I was going back through my profile and want to make sure I answered things correctly before I finalize it.  On health insurance when it asks if me and my spouse are covered by other insurance, does it only mean currently or is it asking if we will continue other coverage after joining the MBO plan?  We have insurance now but will drop it once the Aetna plans start.  I answered that we have it and provided the carrier names. Thanks,Cary p.s.  I emailed my I9 last night. </textOnly>
