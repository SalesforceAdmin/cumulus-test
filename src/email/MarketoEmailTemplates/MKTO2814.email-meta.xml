You can network and market your solo business to perfection, but without the right proposal to finish it off, you can lose the business.
There&apos;s no way to tell how many contracts you have won or lost because of the proposal, but MBO Partners is here to give you an edge. Check out our downloadable guide, &quot;Writing and Delivering a Proposal The Guide to Success &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide/plan/proposal-guide&gt;.&quot;
If you have any further questions about proposal writing or being self-employed, please don&apos;t hesitate to ask.
