Subject: RE: Top 5  Chilli, There are a number of tradeshows.  I actually think there is a small business tradeshow that’s coming up in DC.  You can also sign up for our Independent Consulting Brief. It talks about everything you should be ‘in-the-know’ about regarding consulting or starting your own consulting company.  I would like to introduce you to Sara who you can chat with about what’s out there and how to get started.   Sara, Can you please reach out to Chilli and talk about all the resources that are out there for new IC’s? Steve From: Chilli [mailto:customercare@vortexchillers.com] &lt;mailto:[mailto:customercare@vortexchillers.com]&gt;

Subject: RE: Top 5    Thank you Steve! Do you know of any publications I could be subscribed to for the industry? Also, I am hoping to find a good small business consulting trade show or convention to attend where I could get a clearer idea of how to shape my new consulting business. Any suggestions?    Thanks again,                                  Advice For the Digital AgeChilli Schockwww.smartmarketadvice.com &lt;http://www.smartmarketadvice.com/&gt;(805) 931-6655110 S.

Subject: Top 5    I just listened to your Top 5 webinar and at the end you offered to send example contracts for the different type work you offer to your consult customers. May I ask for these examples?
