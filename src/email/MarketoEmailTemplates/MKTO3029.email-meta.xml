In terms of connecting folks with projects, we recently started a partnership with Work Market &lt;https://www.workmarket.com/&gt; and I encourage you to check out their site. The details of the partnership are still being flushed out but in the meantime you could work directly with them and check out their solutions to connecting folks with projects. 
Stay tuned to learn more about how we will integrate this with MBO’s program. Best of luck to you and best wishes for a lovely holiday! Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Margaret Graves Hi Sara, Thanks for the chat and for reengaging with me. I&apos;m thinking of going independent full time in the coming future. I don&apos;t have any contract currently, but plan to start checking out the market, contacts, etc. I have a call planned with Heidi (StarCypress) in the future as well. I was also curious about any ways that MBO connects independents with work if at all as well. Do you all work with recruiters, or with other independents that have leads? I&apos;m in the planning phases before I graduate so hopefully I can work with you a bit more after the January timeframe (also waiting to see the outcome of the CR expiration!). Hope you&apos;re gearing up for the holidays! Thanks again. Regards,Margaret Graves On Wed, Dec 18, 2013 at 11:42 AM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:
Hello Margaret,
I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?
Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
	- There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one:

           http://www.mbopartners.com/resources/presentations &lt;http://link.mbopartners.com/688NPM52500001W000qOw01&gt;
	- MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, there’s real hard facts about The State of Independence in America &lt;http://link.mbopartners.com/688NPM52500001X000qOw01&gt; that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent.

Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.
