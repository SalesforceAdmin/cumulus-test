    <subject>MBO Newsletter: Consulting on the Side, Giving Back, Creating Value</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
Of all the methods MBO has employed over the years to raise awareness for independents in America, none has been more successful than research. That’s why MBO Partners is teaming up with the Career Advisory Board (CAB) to conduct this short, 10 question survey &lt;https://mbopartners.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_0Bdwv1X6ccVMMkd&gt; to better understand the skills and personal attributes needed to be a successful independent contractor or consultant.
 
Your participation in this survey will help provide advice and counsel to students, young adults and others who are considering a career as an independent professional. Oh - and you&apos;ll be entered in a drawing to win a 16GB iPad as a token of our appreciation.

Emily Stringer, a Consultant Services Advisor for MBO Partners, tells the story of a lawyer that saw an opportunity to consult on the side, and how MBO was able to help him get right to work - minus the administrative tasks.


“Developing a special skillset over a successful career, as well as building your professional network, can set you up well for consulting on the side. For this consultant, MBO was able to help remove some of the burdens of starting a solo business - so he could get to work doing what he loves.”


Who wouldn&apos;t want to line their pockets with some extra cash these days?

What that means is that in a new age of an economy blended with traditional and independent workers, the two work styles are not mutually exclusive.
