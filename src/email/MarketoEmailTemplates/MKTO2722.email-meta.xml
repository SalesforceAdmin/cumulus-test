Subject: MBO Partners- Team Centers Hi Tracey, Thank you for taking the time to speak to me today in regards to setting up a team center with MBO Partners. I wanted to take a moment and introduce you to Sara Conde who I have CC’d on this email. She will be able to assist in negotiating the contract between Ashoka and MBO. Sara can also help set up a team center for the other 5-6 individuals you are thinking to bring on for this project. Good luck with the new project!  Regards, ___________________Meghan MoulBusiness ManagerMBO Partners t: 703.793.6359f: 703.793.6473e: mmoul@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:mmoul@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
