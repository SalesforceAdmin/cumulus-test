That’s great!  The next steps will be for me to reach out to the client and I can send them the Introduction to MBO Partners as well as a brief description of MBO and our MSA so I can introduce myself and get the ball rolling on the contract.  If they want to use their contract at that time they can send it to me and I will have it reviewed and make any necessary changes based on our business model.  You do not need to send them the work order, that is just there if you ever want to send a client a blank SOW for them to fill out, but normally I would send that to them along with our MSA.  
 
The paperwork I will need from them with me a contract (either ours or theirs, fully executed) and a SOW.
 
The next steps for you will be for you to complete the enrollment in our system.  I will send you a link to enroll, and you will follow that link to our site and complete the online paperwork.  Once the online enrollment is complete there will be and enrollment packet that you can print off and in that packet is an I9 form (its page 13 or 14).  You will take that form to a local notary and have them witness your signature and sign in section 2 as an authorized representative.  You just need to fax or email me that form back and that will complete your portion of the paperwork.  
 
In order to activate your account I will need the I9 form, the contract from the client and a SOW detailing your work (this can be our work order form or something from the client).
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions and you should receive the link to enroll in a few minutes.
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette,
 
Thank you for sending this. I had a call tonight with the agency that is hiring me and we are ready to start with the paperwork. I mentioned to them that I was going to work through you and they were perfectly fine with it.
 
Please guide me through the next steps...
1- I will send you the document titled &quot;AN INTRODUCTION TO MBO PARTNERS FOR CLIENTS&quot; right?
2- Do I have to fill out and send them also the form titled: &quot;MBO EXEC WORK ORDER/ADDENDUM&quot;?
3- Is the any other document I need to send, or any other step?
4- What about between your company and me? what forms need to be filled and exchange?
 
Thank you! Have a great weekend!
 
Ivonne

Hi Ivonne,
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you today.  I’ve enclosed a few resources that you might find helpful as discussed:
 
We have created an index of past webinars on topics specifically catered for independent consultants.  You can view our index by going here.   
In addition we have a 2012 Webinar track that will cover everything to do with working independently.  We have three tracks, you can sign up to receive notifications when new webinars are scheduled by going here. 
Lastly, you can view all the information we spoke over the phone by going here.   
If you have questions, feel free to schedule a convenient time for you using my online schedule and we will walk through the net cash estimates I created for you at that time (attached as PDF).
 
I look forward to speaking with you soon!
 
 
Nicolette
