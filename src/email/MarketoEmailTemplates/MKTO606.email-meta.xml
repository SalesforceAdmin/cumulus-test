I wanted to follow up with you.  I noticed you finished your online enrollment in our system.  Everything looks good, did you have any questions? 
 
We spoke a little bit about your next contract or moving over an existing contract; any update as to the timeline one this would be helpful.  In the meantime please reach out to me once you have something and I can start on the paperwork for it. 
 
Look forward to working with you!
 
Steve
