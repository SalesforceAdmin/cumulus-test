Great to hear from you! Congrats on being licensed  what a great accomplishment! Be sure to add this to your linked in credentials so you can publicly brag about it (if you havent already!) I will be in the office all week but on Wednesday I will have an afternoon doctors appoint and on Thusday I am leaving for an offsite meeting in the afternoon. So Wednesday or Thursday morning would work but unfortunately not the afternoon. Let me know if that works for you  I would love to say hello. Thanks for keeping in touch! Thanks!Sara  From: Anthony Gardner [mailto:ATGardner@comcast.net]

Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Tony Gardner Hi Sara, As usual, your timing is impeccable.  My efforts since we spoke last were surprisingly disappointing. Either the market is worse than I anticipated or my marketing pieces suck. [A combination of the two?] I had to break away from that campaign to get prepared for the final exam in the series for my architecture license.  I&apos;m happy to report that I was successful [by a hair?! Just got the report Saturday, 6/30] in that effort and should soon be licensed in NJ and a full member of the American Institute of Architects. Hopefully this will bolster my confidence and drive to get this project off the ground! (It&apos;s been a fairly rough road. On my nerves especially!) I will be taking a week or so for a bit of travel, R&amp;R, and to attend a family gathering in NC. Hey, I&apos;ll be passing right by your offices. I&apos;ll check the map and schedule. If I can I&apos;d love to stop by long enough to say hello. (Will probably be passing by on Wed, 7/11 South and Thurs 7/19 North) Thanks again for all of your help and for thinking of me. I&apos;ll be sure to review the links you sent ASAP. Best regards, Tony----- Original Message ----- From: Sara Conde &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt; To: atgardner@comcast.net &lt;mailto:atgardner@comcast.net&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 28, 2012 5:54 PMSubject: MBO Partners / Tony Gardner 
Hello Tony,
I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?
Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
	- There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one: 

           http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-webcast-index &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPXByb2QtbC0yNzAmbWVzc2FnZWlkPTI3MCZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEzMzQ4ODg0NDImc2VyaWFsPTEyNjQ4NzU0MDQmZW1haWxpZD1hdGdhcmRuZXJAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQmdXNlcmlkPWwtMTI4LTExNzk3LTExMzE5NjkmZXh0cmE9JiYm&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-webcast-index?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvKjNZKXonjHpfsX56u8sUKG%2FlMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ATsBrI%2FqLAzICFpZo2FFVGO8%3D&gt;
	- MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, theres real hard facts about The State of Independence in America &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPXByb2QtbC0yNzAmbWVzc2FnZWlkPTI3MCZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEzMzQ4ODg0NDImc2VyaWFsPTEyNjQ4NzU0MDQmZW1haWxpZD1hdGdhcmRuZXJAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQmdXNlcmlkPWwtMTI4LTExNzk3LTExMzE5NjkmZXh0cmE9JiYm&amp;&amp;&amp;http://info.mbopartners.com/stateofindependence?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvKjNZKXonjHpfsX56u8sUKG%2FlMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ATsBrI%2FqLAzICFpZo2FFVGO8%3D&gt; that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent. 

Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.
