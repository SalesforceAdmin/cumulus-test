Hi Bud,
 
You are very welcome, it was so nice speaking with you yesterday as well.  Regarding your rate, Im glad you were able to speak to colleagues to get an idea of what you want to bill and if you need me to come up with another estimate based on the rate that SRA agrees to with you I would be happy to do so.  For your allowances, when you complete the online enrollment you will fill out a W4 form so that is where you can put how many allowances you would like to claim, all you need to know about the estimate is that it will reflect a lower amount of withholdings, so the net take home will vary from the estimate.  I would again be happy to create another estimate with 0 allowances when you confirm your rate with SRA.  
 
Please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime and I look forward to speaking with you sometime over the next week or two.
 
Have a great weekend!
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette.  Many thanks for all your help and it was great talking with you yesterday.  I&apos;ll get started on the on-line enrollment form that you sent in your other e-mail.
 
There are two things I wanted to let you know about that have changed since we talked.  First, after talking with some colleagues, I want to ask for $100 per hour.  I realized that that figure may get negotiated down some, but based on what I&apos;m hearing from others, particularly in a 1099 situation, it seems fair to ask for.  Second, I choose to claim 0 withholding allowances.  I realize we have a ways to got before that becomes final, but I just wanted to let you know since I told you 2 for the estimate yesterday.
 
I&apos;ll get busy filling out the enrollment form and then I&apos;ll try to get on your calendar for sometime next week.
 
Thanks Nicolette and have a great weekend!
 
Bud
