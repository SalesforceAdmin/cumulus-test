Ill be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services and answer any specific questions you may have.  You may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here. &lt;https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK&gt;   I see that you previously worked through MBO while working with United Health Group so I would like to get a chance to introduce myself over the phone and give you a bit of a refresher on our program and answer any questions you may have.   I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners! Nicolette  ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;bbentley@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: Why Fight Red Tape to Get Your Next Contract? I would be interested in learning more. I received an RFP of sorts from the State of Minnesota recently, and they had a bunch of requirements re insurance, etc. Leah612.270.1563 From: MBO Partners [mailto:info@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:info@mbopartners.com&gt;]

Are you finding it difficult to secure contracts with the organizations you want to work with? 
MBO Partners already has hundreds of master service agreements in place - including with 40 percent of the Fortune 100. We&apos;re also an approved GSA vendor. 

If you choose to work through MBO, you will still find your own contracts and maintain your own network. But you can finally stop fighting vendor red tape rules  and start billing for projects faster. 
Focus on what you do best, and let MBOs back-office management team take care of everything else.
