I’ll be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services and answer any specific questions you may have.  I noticed in your inquiry that you referenced business insurances that you need, and that you were referred by OST Global Solutions.   I wanted to let you know that we are not an insurance company that can provide you with quotes on professional insurance, we are actually an alternative to self incorporation that provides a corporate structure for you to operate your consulting business under, and as a part of our service offerings, you are covered under our umbrella of liability insurance for the projects that are running through our program.    If you would like to hear more information about our program you may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here.  You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube. I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners! Nicolette  ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
