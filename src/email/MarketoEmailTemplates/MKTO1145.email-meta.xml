I know Bruce (copied above) was going to reach out to you to discuss this process. If there is any information you are uncomfortable providing please put “N/A” and we will do the best with the information you provide. If you would like MBO to sign and NDA please let me know and I will arrange that.  Independent Contractor compliance requires that you maintain independence in three primary areas: Behavioral Control, Financial Control, and Type of Relationship (see the IRS rules http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762.html). The purpose of our vender registration process is to evaluate risks, if any, with paying your company directly.  If you are not planning on moving forward please confirm and I will remove your information from our system.
Thank you,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
