Besides getting the I9 back to me, which you mentioned you will do next week, you have done everything on your end, (unless Merlin has any additional onboarding paperwork for you).  I also emailed Linda to let her know you were completed on our side and to ask that she send me a SOW for your work at her convenience.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions for me.
 
Thank you and have a great weekend!
Nicolette

Thanks. I&apos;m done with the form, then. No deductions additional until I&apos;ve got more info from COBRA about healthcare. I emailed LInda Marks at Merlin, but haven&apos;t heard back yet. Anything else I need to do?

Absolutely, you are automatically enrolled but only have to contribute if and when you want to.
 
Just decline for now if you would like to wait.
 
Thanks!

Am I correct in assuming that I can join in the 401k at any time? I need to talk with my financial advisor about this.
