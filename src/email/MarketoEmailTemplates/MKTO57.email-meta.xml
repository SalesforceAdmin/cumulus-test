Can you please review:
1.       Righttorepresent.doc, you will need to sign and return this to me    (There is some non-compete information in this, so please read carefully).  We can review any points on the phone that I think are worth suggest changing, should you want to.  There is some stiff language in this document you need to be aware of.
2.       Info Cubic Release.pdf, you will need to sign and return this to me
3.       I’ve recommended a few changes in the contract, which I generally went over on your voicemail.  Please call or email me back to confirm you are okay with me presenting these changes to Thea.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
