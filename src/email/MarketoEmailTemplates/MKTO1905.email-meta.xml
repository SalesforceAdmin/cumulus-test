Good evening Sara, thank you so much for the send.  I&apos;m soon to be making my transition, as I weigh my options.  I do have a few questions for you, as I become fully entrenched in the in the MBO path, if I ever decide to start my own company and come out from under the MBO shell.  What steps would I have to take in order to do that?  If you wanted to create your own company outside of MBO that is totally your prerogative, though I suspect as you learn to use MBO you may no longer want to. Remember, MBO is an alternative to setting up your own company. There are many steps to take to setting up your own company outside of MBO – which is why many people decide MBO is a better path. The first step would be deciding what business structure you would want (sole proprietorship, LLC, S-Corp.)  There are some great books out there about setting up your own company. One of my favorites is &quot;Start Your Own Consulting Business&quot; &lt;http://www.amazon.com/Start-Your-Own-Consulting-Business/dp/1599180480&gt; Is there something I need to do before coming over to MBO if I know eventually that will be my intention? No, you can do this while you are working at MBO and you can leave MBO at any time to go down this path.  Well either way its all good stuff I appreciate you passing all this useful information and can&apos;t wait to get started with this path. V/R Ms. Peoples Subject: Ready to charge $300 an hour?
