Subject: Re: BAH - TASC Update Sara:  Just connected with Emily at TASC and gave her the rate of $200.00 per hour.   It looks like there may be two SOWs and task orders.  They are still in draft so I have not seen the final versions.  If you get them before me, please shoot me a copy so I can validate the SOW for you.   Talk with you tomorrow.  Best, Mark

I just had a call with Emily Russell from TASC. She will be your initial contact there; she wants you to give her a ring so you can let TASC know your rate. I let her know that our consultants work out their rate directly with the client so she is expecting y our call. She can be reached at 703-633-8336. Thanks!Sara From: Mark Clark [mailto:clarkmark7@gmail.com &lt;mailto:clarkmark7@gmail.com&gt;]

J)  BAH is a great client, they are not only going to pay our fee for you they are paying extra for you to be advanced meaning as soon as your time is approved and invoiced the money will appear in your account. You do not have to wait for them to pay us (told you we had a great relationship with them!)
We have worked with IBM in the past, they would know as MyBizOffice which is our old name (charming huh?) It has the same tax ID as MBO Partners so we could still do business under that name/contract.  Looking forward to connecting on Friday  congrats on the BAH gig! Sara  From: Mark Clark [mailto:clarkmark7@gmail.com &lt;mailto:clarkmark7@gmail.com&gt;]

Subject: Re: BAH Hi Sara:

Yes, I heard this morning that BAH had approved the PO.  My rate for this task will be $200.00 per hour.  Hope this is what it says.

Was looking on the web site and found the MBO Exec Work Order/Addendum.  Do you need to fill that out and return it to you?  I have not seen the final SOW (the one you must have) - only the input I gave BAH.  Am assuming the task language is just what the Booz PM and I agreed too.

On another company, I talked with TASC yesterday, they are going to take longer than originally thought.  It&apos;s most likely going to be August before they come through (and then their hair will be on fire), but am very confident they will come through at more hours than Booz Allen.

Finally, does MBO have a relationship yet with IBM for consultant work?  Am working angle there now but I will likely need to make some marketing calls on that one.

Is there anything else I need to do on my end??  How do I proceed with the AMEX Card??  Do I need to fill something out?
