Subject: RE: MBO Partners Enrollment Information Sara…I have completed the online registration form. I will get the paperwork notarized this week-  Fantastic thanks! Two questions:  1)      I could not completely fill out the references sections and projects sections on my profile—for some reason I could not enlarge the box so that I could see all the fields on my computer. Is there a way to send you information that could be put in for me?  I am not sure what section you are referring to. If you log in  you will have access to change any of the information that you put in (or did not put in) during enrollment. Let me know if you have trouble.2)      Where do I go from here to solicit business from MBO clients? The best thing to do is approach clients we have an MSA with and let them know you are already working with “approved vender” (MBO) this makes you a more attractive candidate as the hiring manager would not have to complete additional paperwork to bring you on.  Are there any clients you are particularly interested in? You can always ask me if we have an MSA in place.Thanks!  You are welcome – let me know how I can help! Christi Lowe From: Sara Conde  &lt;mailto:[mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com]&quot;&gt;[mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com]&lt;span style=&apos;mso-bookmark:_MailOriginal&gt;
