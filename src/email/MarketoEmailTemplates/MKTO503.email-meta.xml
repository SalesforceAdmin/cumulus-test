Thanks for the reply, much appreciated and the explanation as well.  We have been running into this more and more for the more simple billing scenerios.  We have considered having multiple programs but decided to just stick with one for now. I will say there is no harm in giving MBO Partners a try since we only take a percentage (5%), you can always discontinue using our services if you find that you are not getting the value you expected.  
 
We also came up with this cool widget on our website that walks through, dollar for dollar, the value of using MBO over doing it on your own.  Going through this might help realize some of the value that may go more unnoticed.   
 
If you spend a few minutes going through this and it generates some interest, I would love to chat with you more.  You can always book a time in my online schedule by going here. 
 
Have a great upcoming holiday,
 
Steve

Steve,
 
I have always been interested in your services.  It is just that I am not overwhelmed with what I need to do to keep my 1 monthly invoice and payroll going.  I know I spend some time and money doing all of the invoicing taxes and payroll, but never thought your service was the value I needed for the costs. If that has changed, I am happy to discuss my situation, but I am not sure it has.

Dear Chris,

It’s been some time since we last spoke, but I appreciate your interest in working with MBO Partners, and wanted to check in and share some news with you.

We recently launched a new Web site with a set of powerful tools built-in to help those assessing and getting ready for independent work to find their right fit. 

I wanted to share these tools with you personally, and encourage you to take a quick look.

Perhaps you are happily independent now, and have found a solution to manage your business life -- or you may have returned to working full time, or perhaps be in the midst of a search.

Whatever your work life stage, I hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independence in America has arrived, with a  workforce 16 million strong, and predicted to grow to more than 20 million by 2013. Our company well into a year-long journey to better understand and celebrate independent work in our nation, called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view the site&apos;s very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.

I do hope you will take time to learn if MBO Partners is right for you or not. Please stay in touch and let me know how I can help further your career. Parting thought: do you already know that number-one challenge or opportunity I can help you with?

Steve Arhancet
