That works for me, you should get a calendar update from me!  No worries, people do it all the time :)  I go by Niki also if you prefer that.

I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow!

Have a great evening,
Nicolette

Let's do 9:00 CST. And I just noticed that your name is Nicolette, sorry! I have been misspelling it all along!

Thanks,

>> Sure!  I will only have about 30 minutes to speak if we reschedule for 4:30 as I have an appointment I have to leave the office for but if you would like to call me when you are available that works for me.  I also want to make sure, are you on the east coast?  If you are in another time zone I will not be available at that time.
