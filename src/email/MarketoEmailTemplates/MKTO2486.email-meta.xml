    <subject>Webinar: Research on Generation X Independent Workers</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Consultant}},
 
 On April 4 at 1 p.m. ET, we will hold a webinar entitled &quot;Working to Live, Not Living to Work: Five Insights into the Gen X Workforce &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/5Apr13WebGenX_RegistrationPage.html&gt;.&quot;


MBO Partners is shaking up our webinar series with a special edition webinar featuring original research on the midcareer worker. Be the first to delve into the data on Gen X independents as Steve King and Carolyn Ockels, Partners at Emergent Research, discuss MBO&apos;s top five insights into independent professionals age 33 to 48. 

Why is this generation leading the movement toward independent work? What personal lessons can you take away from the experience of this creative, committed and satisfied workforce cohort?


 

Register today &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/5Apr13WebGenX_RegistrationPage.html&gt; to get a fuller picture of how Gen X works independent.
