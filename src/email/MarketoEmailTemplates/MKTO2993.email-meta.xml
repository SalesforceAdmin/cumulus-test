We must now determine if you meet the criteria for operating as a sub-contracted vendor in Canada as you work on your project.   Action Required: Please complete this Qualification Questionnaire &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/redirect/vqq.html&gt;. We recommend setting aside about 30 minutes.   What Comes Next: Once you’ve completed the questionnaire, MBO will contact you to discuss your responses, determine next steps (which may include submitting supporting documentation), and prepare you for enrollment. Best regards, ___________________Meghan MoulConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6359f: 703.793.6473e: mmoul@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:mmoul@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
