I just received the work orders from H2O today and will work to get them entered this evening so I can activate your account and you can enter your time for it to invoice tomorrow.  Unfortunately it took longer to get the contract in place on their end than originally anticipated, but we will be able to invoice your time from 11/28 through 12/15 as soon as we activate you.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions and you will receive email notification once your account has been activated.
 
Thank you and have a great evening,
Nicolette

Hi Nicol, I havent heard from anyone as to wheather or not all the paperwork has been done from H2o. I was curious what was happening and when we were going to get started with the process. I didnt know if we were going to get started now or the first of the year. Regardless I need to find out so I can see about getting paid from my first pay period with H2o. 
Thanks Dave McMahill

Hi David,
 
The page doesn’t need to be stamped but a notary does HAVE to sign as an authorized representative.   Since I will not be meeting you in person we deem a notary a person of trust to sign the I9 form in MBO’s absence.  If you used your passport as the primary identification you will have to send that along with the I9 form anyway because eVerify does photo matching with the List A identifications.  
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Next question: RE I-9 form can we send you a copy of Drivers license and SS# or Passport rather than have page notarized?

Hi David,
 
Yes you are correct.  The contract is referring to labor when it talks about the fees being deducted.  When expenses come in to our system they are credited to you ledger and labeled as expenses and the fee is not taken from that.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions about this.
 
Thank you and have a great weekend,
Nicolette

Hi Nicol, when we spoke on the phone I asked about expenses; you said that expenses were passed thru with no cost. I dont see that in the contract anywhere. However on the bottom of the first page 2b it says &quot;fees will be deducted from all payments received from client&quot;. As an example I have out of pocket expenses for airfare and rental car as I explained on the phone. I&apos;m sure you told me that there was no cost associated with doing that and the fee was based souly on the billed hours/timesheet. Did I get that right?
Thanks
