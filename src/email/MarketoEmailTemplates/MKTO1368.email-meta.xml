Can you log in and update it by clicking on “payroll” (top grey menu) and then “direct deposit” (left menu bar.) Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
