Hi Arnold,
 
Great.  I would be happy to have a conversation with him to explain our business model and address his concerns, and if he has a specific document in mind I would be happy to review it.
 
Please let me know when you are ready to move forward and provide me with Winstons contact information and I will reach out to him.
 
Have a great evening,
Nicolette

Nicolette,

I should be speaking with Winston today about my rate. He indicated MBO will need to sign a non-compete form, for him to feel comfortable.
