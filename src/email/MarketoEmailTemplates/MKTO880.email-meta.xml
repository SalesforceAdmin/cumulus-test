    <textOnly>That works for me, you should get a calendar update from me!  No worries, people do it all the time :)  I go by Niki also if you prefer that. I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow! Have a great evening, Nicolette  ___________________________________ Nicolette Taylor Consultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6281 f: 703.793.6456 e: ntaylor@mbopartners.com w: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

I will only have about 30 minutes to speak if we reschedule for 4:30 as I have an appointment I have to leave the office for but if you would like to call me when you are available that works for me.  I also want to make sure, are you on the east coast?  If you are in another time zone I will not be available at that time. &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Thank you! &gt;&gt; Nicolette &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; ___________________________________ &gt;&gt; Nicolette Taylor &gt;&gt; Consultant Services Advisor &gt;&gt; MBO Partners &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; t: 703.793.6281 &gt;&gt; f: 703.793.6456 &gt;&gt; e: ntaylor@mbopartners.com &gt;&gt; w: www.mbopartners.com &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
