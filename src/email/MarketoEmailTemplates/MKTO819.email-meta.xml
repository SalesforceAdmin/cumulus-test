Hi Sara,
 
I&apos;m still considering my options, and one of my clients is out of town until next week, so I don&apos;t have a final answer yet. However, I am still very interested. One question I didn&apos;t elaborate on during our phone call was the issue of insurance. How is this handled by MBO partners? If I sign up, what are my options for Health and Dental coverage?
 
Thanks a bunch,
Brian
