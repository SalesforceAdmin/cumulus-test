Hi Nicolette, I was able to get the I9 signed by Stacy E, the the notary contact you sent me.  I will email you a copy of the signed doc plus a picture of my passport this morning. Please email the I-9 and passport photo directly to me.   I need to go back and tweak my 401K deductions so that I get the right amount in savings and still have something left in the pay check Please let me know if I can assist you with this.  I need to go through the training videos, but 2 quick questions 1) THe website has a model that generates 10% profit for the business.  How is that 10% managed?  Is that part of my pay check, auto deposited into a separate business account managed by me, held and managed by Return Path. The 10% profit is managed by billing the correct rate to get you to a 10% profit after all taxes, benefits, vacation, etc. The profit is not displayed nor is it deposited into a separate account. All funds are deposited to the personal bank account provided to MBO during your online enrollment. That being said you do have do the ability to enter multiple bank accounts and set a specific % of your paycheck going to each account. Please let me know if  you need help with this.  2) Non reimbursable expenses (non project related) like internet and phone costs, office deductions (which was part of the sign up process).  Can I submit expenses prior to our contract (from the beginning of 2012). Unfortunately we are not able to process expenses incurred before your MBO start date. You may be able to write these off on your personal taxes.  Besides std office expenses, I attended a conference in the UK for sales purposes (conference and several sales calls).              a) I assume I can submit those Yes, you can.             b) How are they tracked for tax purposes and/or paid back to me?  If I have $5K in expenses and only earn 3K the first pay period from this first contract do I get sent the $3k and have a remaining balance of 2K?  I assume I don&apos;t  a paycheck since anything earned goes to expenses.  If thats the case, then 401K and insurance and ta deductions start when invoice revenue exceeds expenses, right? Great questions. If expenses exceed revenue we will put the expenses against the available account balance, and process a payment to you in the next available payment cycle. So in the example above, if you have 5k in expenses in and 3k in professional fees we will put 3k in expenses against your 3k in professional fees allowing you to take home a tax free 3k.We call this an “expense only payroll.”  Since there is no traditional gross in a payroll like this 401(k) etc would not apply. You would then have 2k in remaining expenses to apply to your next payroll to yourself when more professional fees are earned. Please let me know if you have any additional questions about this.  Thank you!Sara Thanks for all of your work on this account so far. Dave LaBerge  David LaBergeLaBerge LLCdavid@labergellc.com408.649.3094 (W)408.504.7454 (C) On Mar 26, 2012, at 9:11 AM, Nicolette Taylor wrote:Hi David, Here is the contract, please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Pay most attention to the last page.  If you have any questions please give me a call, otherwise just let me know you are comfortable with everything in here.  The only thing they did not agree to that we proposed was the bi-lateral termination that we discussed on the phone. Thanks!Nicolette ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
