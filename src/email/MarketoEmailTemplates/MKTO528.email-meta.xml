There is nothing else I need from you once I have the I9 form.  Thanks for letting me know and once I have a SOW from Virtuoz, we will work to get you activated sometime near the first of the year.
 
Have a great week and Happy Holidays!
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette,
 
I’ve completed the online enrollment, and will be submitting the signed I9 &amp; Passport copy on Friday, December 23rd.
 
Please let me know what other information is necessary, and what the next steps may be.
 
Thanks,
