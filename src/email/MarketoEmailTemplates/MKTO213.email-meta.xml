Thank you for letting me know.  Have you let Parametrix know about putting the process on hold, or would you like me to still work on the contract if they respond to me?  Please let me know.
 
Thank you and let me know if you have any questions or I can help you out with anything.
 
Nicolette

Thank you Nicolette.
 
I have a couple of things developing personally and will be putting this process on hold for a couple of weeks.
 
I have a couple of full-time employment offers and need to work with those employers to evaluate the best path forward.
 
Thanks for your help so far.
 
Regards,

Darold

Hi Charlie,
 
I hope your week is going well so far.  I wanted to follow up with you on the contract I sent over on Thursday on behalf of Darold Woodward.  I wanted to first see if you had any questions about the contract and then also see what the status of your review is.  I would be happy to answer any questions you have and give you further information on MBO Partners if you would like.  
 
I look forward to hearing from you,  have a great day!
 
Nicolette

Nicolette,
 
OK, I had a substantial conversation with Marstel Day this morning. It appears that they will want to establish a working consultative relationship with me. 
 
Juli MacDonald Winbush will be the point of contact for Marstel Day with MBO Partners.
 
I&apos;ve completed the enrollment process and signed the agreement. The proverbial ball is now in your court. Please advise if I can answer any questions that might arise.
 
Regards,
 
John
