If you need to give them my direct contact information to help things go through smoother please feel free to do so. I speak to many companies and I can answer any of their questions and explain that you are a project based worker with MBO.
Thanks Bruce!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: Background check Sara, Thank you. I put 7-01-2002 to present. Apparently that was a big mistake. If I truly worked for myself it would work out that way. Thanks for the exact dates. I hope this isn&apos;t a show stopper.Best Regards Bruce Hankinshttp://about.me/bruce.hankins &lt;http://about.me/bruce.hankins&gt; Sent from my iPod Touch

Subject: Background check Hi Sara, I&apos;m filling out information for a background check online with CERTIPHI. My Dashboard says MBO Exec since 01/09/2012. Can you tell me the actual date I started? I accepted a permanent employment position. By the way, you have a great picture on Linkedin.  Best regards, Bruce Hankins
