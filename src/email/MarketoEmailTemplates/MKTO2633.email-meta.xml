The next step is sending me a copy of your completed I-9.  You can find the I-9 form in your enrollment documents; you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.)  I will also need you to send me a copy of your US passport (you can just take a picture with your phone and email that to me.) I also need you to log in to MBO Access &lt;https://access.mbopartners.com/&gt; and complete the “Industry Expertise” and “Disciplines” sections of your profile. This information needed for our workmen’s comp. policy and must be completed before I can activate your account and get you billing. Your user ID is the same as your MBO Business Center and your temporary password is “password123” Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
