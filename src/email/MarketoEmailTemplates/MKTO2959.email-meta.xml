2013 Wrap Up: Is your Business Center Ready for a New Year?
As 2013 draws to a close, you may be asking yourself: is my business ready for a new year? Between the turkey and the tinsel, take time this holiday season to tie up any loose ends in your MBO Business Center.  
 
In our last newsletter of the year, we wanted to gather items to help prepare for a New Year. Is your address up to date? Have you submitted all medical expenses? Are you familiar with the Account Balance Carry Over Policy? If not, take a look at our  Account Balance Policy &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/YearEndWrapUp2013.html&gt; and HR &amp; Expense Reminders &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/YearEndHRUpdate2013.html&gt; now to make sure you have completed everything you need for a successful 2014! If you have any questions, contact your Business Manager today.

Poll Results: Are You Part of the 88%?
In our July Associate Newsletter, we asked you, our valued Associates, to take a poll on what motivates you as Independent Consultants. Thank you for participating, the quick survey helps us to tailor programs that will interest our Associates and we wanted to share with you some of the interesting results! 

When it comes to lining up your next consulting project, 64% of our Associates find their next project leads from a colleague, while 56% look to their current client for the next gig. If your current clients or colleagues could lead to your next big deal, make sure you are doing the most to build lasting client relationships &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/6-tips-building-lasting-client-relationships&gt;. 

Social Media &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/5-ways-use-social-media-promote-your-independent-consulting-business&gt; allows Independent Consultants the ability to connect with millions of potential, engaged online customers.  Among our Associates, LinkedIn has the highest social media presence with 88% of respondents saying they have an active LinkedIn profile.  Facebook was the second most used with 44% using Facebook to enhance their business. Twitter users only make up 28% of those polled. If you aren&apos;t promoting your business online, you could be missing potential clients and connections.

How to Keep your Independent Business Booming this Holiday Season
Taking time for friends, family and relaxation during the holiday season is important, but that does not mean your independent business has to suffer.  You can use holiday down time to make connections (both new and old) and ensure your business is booming in 2014! 

Customers and prospects often get distracted with other objectives as the year winds down, and that may make it more difficult for you to connect with them. Losing face time (and phone time) with your customers will impact sales if you haven’t planned ahead. So, if the economy has you stressed and your independent contractor business can’t take a hiatus over the holidays, try these tactics to help reach your business goals and sign that next contract.

CEO CORNER
3 Reasons We Should Give Thanks to Independents this Season

Family, friends, good health and fried turkey – it’s not such a bad situation to be thankful for the same blessings, year in and year out.

But this year, all Americans, especially our business community, have nearly 18 million new reasons to be thankful this year: the self-employed workers that make our country tick. More&gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/CEOCornerNov13.html&gt;
EXECUTIVE EDITORIAL
Jay Lash, VP Market Strategy, on a Malcolm Gladwell TedTalk

In my work, I am often challenged to think through a problem and come up with a solution. Sure, I have good experience to base my solutions on and I am a relatively bright guy, but that isn’t why I can make my living from coming up with solutions.

When I am posed these challenges I don’t just start solving, I study them first.
