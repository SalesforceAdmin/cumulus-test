Here are a few things:
 
·         Updated estimate per your notes below so you can have an accurate illustration for yourself.
·         The updated contract; made for use with MBO Partners that would be executed between MBO and the Client
 
Next steps:
 
·         Introduce me to the point of contact at the client once they have accepted your proposal for work (usually via email is best.  Steve meet x, x meet Steve).  I will then reach out to them, ask about the agreement; deliver one already completed; explain the relationship and work on any other paperwork that is necessary for you to get started. 
·         I need to clarify some questions with you regarding the expenses, total budget that I was not clear on based on the Appendix A and if the client had confirmed this or if it was still being proposed.
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Steve,
Thanks for the cash flow estimate.  I kind wish it was in some kind of excel form I can play around with and not bother you with every little change, but this is very useful.  Ok, a couple quick notes.
I think $75.00 an hour is going to be what IFAW settles on I should put down about $1000 in anticipated membership fees Office expense is probably around $2,000 a year, maybe $5,000 year one If I do private medical dental, it’ll be about $750 a month.  Like I said, I’ll probably do that at first and then move to MBO’s after 3 months. Computer or other equipment is probably going to be about $5,000 in year one and less thereafter I’ll probably have about $4,000 in non-billable travel.
I’m currently confused about this whole definition of billable time so I gotta make sure I’m clear on that.  Attached is the contract template I used to use when I worked for the organization.   There’s also attached a doc that I used to outline what I’ll be working on it.

Ok, so what’s the next step?
