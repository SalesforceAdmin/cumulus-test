I usually like to schedule these “welcome calls” so that I don’t catch someone in the middle of a meeting or interrupt them at work and email is usually an efficient way to do that but I understand where you are coming from. I know everyone works differently so I will make sure we communicate primarily by phone. Thanks,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: MBO Partners - Time Card Reminder 
I requested a meeting to discuss time and other issues.  It is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.  will I only receive emails from MBO and never a phonecall?    Its a bit impersonal to do everything by text including scheduling of a meeting in my opinion.  I feel that I am missing things as a result ie entering time.  On Apr 29, 2012 6:57 PM, &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:According to our records, there is no time entered in the period indicated for the following work order(s):
