I’ll be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services and answer any specific questions you may have.   We can work with Candaian citizens who are coming to the US to work via a TN visa but unfortuenitly we do not operate in Candia as we are not se up for Candian tax witholidng. If you Google key words like, “employer of record, canada”, “umbrealla company, Canada” I am sure you will find a services similar to ours. I will ask around and see if I can get you a refferal. Take care, Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
