FOUR SCENARIOS WHEN YOU 
SHOULD TURN DOWN A PROJECT
As an independent consultant, particularly if you’re new to the field, it’s tempting to accept every prospective project that comes your way. After all, clients and the projects they provide are your source of income. However, just because an opportunity is presented doesn’t mean the project is right for your business. Here are four situations in which you might be better off turning down a job.

 1.   You’re Overbooked

Every project you take on will require resources, your time, energy, and focus will be expended. When presented with a new project, consider your current obligations and make an honest determination of whether you have too much on your plate to accept the offer. By taking on a project that you don’t truly have time for you will be overpromising yourself to your client &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/pitfalls-overselling-yourself&gt;, and also potentially putting a healthy work-life balance &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/finding-work-life-balance-independent-consultant-0&gt; at risk. Though it may seem like a nice problem to have, having too much work is just that – a problem. If you take on more than you can handle, you may end up disappointing your client and hurting your professional reputation. (A tip: Have a rolodex of good contacts that you trust, whom you can refer the client to for this work, or subcontract it and manage the client relationship, to continue to keep your client happy).

Nicolette Taylor, a Consultant Services Advisor for MBO Partners, shares the story of the referral of a big firm consultant that wanted a new, higher income rate, and a new life pace. 

“I personally have this conversation multiple times a week. It’s the group I called &apos;primed for independence.&apos; They know the consulting field, they simply need the support for all the details they don’t want to be bothered with.”

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. When am I paid if I run projects through MBO Partners?
A. The answer varies, but in most cases you are paid when the client pays.  As your business partner, we deliver an invoice based on the contract (weekly, monthly, as incurred, etc.) and then wait for payment based on the net payment terms that were negotiated. (Side note: we are really good at negotiating good payment terms). Payments could be due upon receipt, or have net payment terms of 15, 30 days, etc.  Once the payment comes in – it’s deposited into your online account with MBO Partners.  You then apply all of your tax deductions to maximize the benefits of being a solo practice, before applicable taxes are applied.  The net amount is then directly deposited into the bank account of your choice.  MBO’s accounting team takes the funds available in your account every Tuesday and processes them, allowing the net amount to appear in your bank account the same Friday.  In special circumstances, we also advance payment for experienced practices and creditworthy clients.

TESTIMONIAL
“I didn&apos;t know what to expect after hiring them, but I have been very impressed with their back-office website and ability to execute on all my needs. To summarize: their fee is irrelevant compared to the W2 alternative, benefits offered, and much reduced tax burden.   If you have the option of going 1099, hire MBO and don&apos;t look back.”
