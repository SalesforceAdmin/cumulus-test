Unfortunately I have had an unexpected meeting pop up right around our call time so I wanted to let you know it may be closer to 3pm. I will call you as soon as I can. Looking forward to connecting! Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
