It was nice speaking with you today. Your best bet to secure benefits for your employees is by going with a Professional Employer Organization (PEO.) If you just type “PEO” into Google you will find many to choose from. Please let me know if I can help. Take care,Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e:  &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&quot;&gt;sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
