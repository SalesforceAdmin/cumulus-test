I emailed Brittney and she informed me that they are not moving forward with you and to disregard the referral.  What MBO provides is an alternative for 1099 contractors to self incorporation.  I have included some information below in case you are interested in speaking with me still as you can choose to use our services if you find consulting projects on your own.

Thank you,
Nicolette
