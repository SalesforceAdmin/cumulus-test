    <subject>MBO Partners Announces Key Brand Investments and Important Changes</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{First Name:default=edit me}},

As business migrates to the new “Project Economy” with more and more work being procured on a contract basis, MBO Partners felt compelled to enhance our messaging and demonstrate how our solutions are central to this growing trend.

To that end, I want you to be among the first to know that MBO Partners is launching a refreshed brand to the marketplace. We’re initially announcing this to our key client partners and independent contractor Associates.

Please take a moment to review our new web sites:

    •  www.mboenterprise.com, covering our solutions and value for enterprise organizations, and
    •  www.mbopartners.com, an interactive new site for our independent contractor audience

Next week, we will also launch a new and easier-to-use interface for our core MBO online system. This will improve the experience for your independent workers and managers alike.

As always, we thank you for your business and look forward to serving you and your independent contractors well into the future. 

Sincerely,

Gene Zaino
President and CEO
MBO Partners
