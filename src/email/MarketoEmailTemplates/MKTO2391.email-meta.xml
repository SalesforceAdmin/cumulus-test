CEO CORNER
Re-energize Your Independent Career

You may find that your independent consultancy is hitting a lull in 2013; Contracts may have dried up, old clients may be shrinking your scope of work, and even contracts fueled by ever-reliable government spending face the threat of cutbacks. It sounds like doom and gloom, but I&apos;m here to encourage you. 2013 can be a year of opportunity and growth, if you&apos;re willing to make some changes.
