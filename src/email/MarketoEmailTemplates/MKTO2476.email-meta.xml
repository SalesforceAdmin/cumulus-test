She will also introduce you to MBO Access, our online community of consultants, valuable resources, and information about the organizations that use MBO to engage their consultants. As your primary point of contact, Cara will be able to offer you in-depth guidance on our programs, serving as your advocate to support you on any day-to-day issues regarding payments, invoices, expenses, and setting up new client contracts. I have reviewed your account history with Cara and she looks forward to working with you.  Of course, I am always here to help with anything as well. Cara will be reaching out to you soon to introduce herself and orient you to MBO Access, and she can always be reached directly at 703-793-6021 or cobrien@mbopartners.com &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9c2FodW50MUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0JnVpZD0wJmV4dHJhPU1UTXhmSE55WTJsa1BUazNmRzFoYVd4cFpEMDFaRFJqTTJVMk5TMWxNVGd3TFRReU5qSXRPV00zT0MwM09HTmxaVFV5TW1Zek5UUXRPVGQ4Wm5KdmJUMXVkR0Y1Ykc5eVFHMWliM0JoY25SdVpYSnpMbU52Ylh4emRXSnFQVWx1ZEhKdlpIVmpkR2x2YmlCVWJ5QlpiM1Z5SUU1bGR5QkNkWE5wYm1WemN5Qk5ZVzVoWjJWeT0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9Y29icmllbkBtYm9wYXJ0bmVycy5jb20mdWlkPTAmZXh0cmE9TVRNeGZITnlZMmxrUFRrM2ZHMWhhV3hwWkQwME1qWTJOR1l3T0MwME9UbGxMVFJoWkdNdE9UVTFOaTFoTm1RelpEWTJNRFl3WkRRdE9UZDhabkp2YlQxdWRHRjViRzl5UUcxaWIzQmhjblJ1WlhKekxtTnZiWHh6ZFdKcVBVbHVkSEp2WkhWamRHbHZiaUJVYnlCWmIzVnlJRTVsZHlCQ2RYTnBibVZ6Y3lCTllXNWhaMlZ5PSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;mailto:cobrien%40mbopartners.com?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCeF5bp05z5dyUIKb9nifUdJ26qPJ%2BBvqMuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&amp;mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCaFBRoEliutycI7v5lznJdJPmtblpY52MuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&gt;.  It has been a real pleasure assisting you in your orientation to MBO Partners.  Best regards, ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;bbentley@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt;   Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
