Subject: RE: Mason / MBO Follow Up Thanks Dave &amp; Thanks Gene for all your time yesterday (as well as Marcelle &amp; Sara) I’ll let the Masons comment on the punch list items.  Ed &amp; I are in agreement that we should test the waters with some of these things to effectively develop some empirical data that would assist a Tidewater vehicle / venture with MBO in terms of structure &amp; logistics / workflow.  I also suspect we will be doing some modeling with the Masons during this time as well in prepositioning further ideas.  We do believe that if successful, the model could work in certain market spaces / locales in different regions of the US. Thanks again &amp; everyone Happy Holidays!! Best Regards, Kurt K.

Subject: Mason / MBO Follow Up All, Many thanks to the Mason team for hosting our meeting yesterday. We appreciate your hospitality and willingness to review potential mutually rewarding teaming arrangements. Here are the action items I believe we agreed to: 1.       Mason will send along some initial contacts who they feel may be appropriate for the MBO Exec Service. This will help with proof of concept to see if the individuals are a good fit for the service, and provide Mason with some feedback on the receptiveness of their clientele to the model. Sara is copied on this email: Sara please provide the rest of your contact information and your web profile.2.       MBO and Mason will review potential radio opportunities in the Tidewater area targeting the high end military retiree. These include:a.       Initial interview with Gene on Mike’s weekly radio show.b.      Evaluation of the efficacy of advertising in this market.3.       MBO will look to Mason to participate in future MBO events, including our Webinar series and social events.4.       Kurt will explore ways to leverage additional value add services, and also review expansion into other geographies once we have some proof of concept. Let me know if I missed something as we covered a lot of ground. We’ll plan to reconvene after the first of the year via conference call to see about progress in these areas. Attached is the presentation and draft intro documents for your records. Thank you again for taking the time with us, and we hope this can become a valuable venture for all involved.__________________________________________DAVE PUTTVice President, Eastern Region
