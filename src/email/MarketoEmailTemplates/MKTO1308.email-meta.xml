If it works for you, Thursday is best for me as I have to leave the office early tomorrow for a doctor’s appointment. Do you prefer morning or afternoon on Thursday?  Morning – I can do 10am and 10:30am Afternoon – any time after 2pm.  Just let me know and I will send you an invite via outlook– looking forward to meeting you in person!
Take care,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: T Erickson Fm I-9 Hi Tom,
I will continue to be your contact. We don’t give out contact names at our clients but we do allow you to state that you are working with an “approved vender MBO Partners as an Associate.” If you are curious about whom we have a master agreement with you can ask me a few names and I will look them up to tell you if we have an MSA. Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
