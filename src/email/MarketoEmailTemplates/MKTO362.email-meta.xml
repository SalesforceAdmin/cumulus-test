No need to apologize, I’m sorry the project did not work out for you.  Are you interested in moving forward with MBO for another project?
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions for me as well.
 
Have a great day and a Happy Thanksgiving!
 
Nicolette

Hi Michelle,
 
I hope all is well!  I wanted to follow up from our conversation regarding MBO Partners.  I know you had expressed interest in using our services for your work with Grady Memorial Hospital.  Any update would be great and I look forward to hearing from you.
 
Have a great day,
 
Nicolette
