Hi George,
 
I just left you a voicemail.  Thank you for completing the online enrollment. The last step is sending me a copy of your completed I-9.  You can find the I-9 form in your enrollment documents (also attached above); you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.)  
 
Once I have a copy of this signed form I can activate your account and walk you through the billing process. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.

Thanks!
Sara

Actually I do. When I completed the enrollment I had printer problems and I was unable to print the required forms. Can I call you in the morning, so I can finally complete this I get my billing in?
