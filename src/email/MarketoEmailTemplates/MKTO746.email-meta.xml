That is correct with one slight (but important) change, it’s when we receive the funds from the client not when we bill them. The only way MBO gets paid is when your client pays the invoice and sends the money to MBO. This will prompt the funds to show up in your business account and from there  you can decide how you would like to payroll yourself form your business.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
 
Thanks!

Hi Sara,
 
Question for you. We are paid (and pay MBO) only when we bill a client - is that right? I couldn&apos;t find in my notes where I referenced the process.
 
Thanks!
Tom
