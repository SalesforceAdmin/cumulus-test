Subject: Re: Earlier appointment time? I&apos;m watching my kids today and they wont be down for a nap until at least 1:00. You can try giving me a call a bit early, say 1:15 or so if that works.

Subject: Earlier appointment time?Hi Marc, I hope your day is going well so far.  I was wondering if you may be available to speak at 12:30 today instead of 1:30?  I have another meeting that I may have to be a part of that is supposed to start at 1:45 so I didnt want to rush through our call.  If you are not available at 12:30 that is fine and we can keep our call time at 1:30. Please advise. Thank you!Nicolette ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: postmaster@mbopartners.com &lt;bbentley@mbopartners.com&quot;&gt;ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
