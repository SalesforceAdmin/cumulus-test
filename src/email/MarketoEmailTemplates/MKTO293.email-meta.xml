It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier today!  I asked around and we do not have an official enterprise relationship with BAE Systems, we have had consultants work with BAE through MBO in the past so we may be able to use the contract in the system but I am going to go in with the assumption that we cannot until I speak with your contact at BAE.  Often there are different divisions within companies and the contracts we have are not always able to be used based on what division it was negotiated with.  I will be your point of contact moving forward and would like to have a more in depth conversation with you before reaching out to BAE to go over the MBO Business model so I have attached a link to my calendar below for you to schedule a convenient time for us to speak.

I have also included some additional information about MBO below for your review before we speak.

Have a great evening,
