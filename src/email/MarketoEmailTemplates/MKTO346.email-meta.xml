I emailed you a few weeks ago regarding the referral from Dennis Chapman who thought you might be interested in hearing more information regarding the services offered by MBO Partners.  Now might not be the right time for you.  If you would like to simply reply to this email with a good time in the future to reach out - I will make sure I follow up with you then. 
 
Regards,
 
Nicolette

Hi Ted,
 
Dennis Chapman recently shared your information with MBO Partners, and as a courtesy, I wanted to follow up on the voicemail I left you to see if you had an interest in hearing more about MBO and the solutions we provide to Independent Consultants.   I wanted to introduce myself as the person at MBO Partners responsible for all new associate and partnership requests. I am including my contact information.  And, so you may easily book a time that is convenient for you, I am including a link to my online schedule: https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK
 
You can also watch a short video about who we are on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKDzwSTmGv4&amp;hd=1.
 
I look forward to speaking with you.
 
Have a great evening,
 
Nicolette
