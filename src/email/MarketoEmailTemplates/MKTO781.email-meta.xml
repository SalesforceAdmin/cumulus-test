You are so welcome – I am looking forward to working with you! Good to know…I will certainly keep you in the loop. I spoke to my boss on the phone today and he is going to follow up with Exponential to ensure we are not having people two invoicing cycles in arrears. Appreciate the heads up and the insight.
 
Have a great night,
Sara

Thanks again for your help today. I was just talking to the HR Manager, and she was under the impression we were rolling over on 02/01/12.  Let me know what you hear. J

Dear Kelly ,
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you.  You’ll find everything that I referenced on our call by going here. I am looking into the January invocing issure and will let you know as soon as I have an update. 
 
We are also promoting our new meet the independents project and are taking applications if you would like to be featured.  You can view the program by going here. 
 
I will follow up with you on Wednesday as promised, should you have questions before then, please schedule a convenient time using my online schedule.
 
Best regards,
Sara
