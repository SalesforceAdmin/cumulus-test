    <subject>MBO Newsletter: Redefining Retirement, Tackling 2014 and Work-Life Balance</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
The new year comes with new challenges, new opportunities and new questions. Whether you&apos;re wondering if being self-employed is right for you, or you&apos;re navigating retirement after a long career, MBO Partners is here to help you make your 2014 transition.

We&apos;ve developed two tools you can use to get a head start on 2014. You can take our quiz, Is It Right For You? &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/right-for-you&gt;, to see if an independent career fits your lifestyle.

INDEPENDENTS AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in March 2010. There are nearly 11,000 pages of regulation for this one law, and contained within those 11,588,500 words there is important information that impacts independent consultants.

There has been a dizzying array of information published about ACA, but many independent professionals and solopreneurs want bottom-line information that will help them to make decisions about their health insurance needs.

While the ACA continues to evolve and change, in this guide we provide independent consultants with an overview of the Affordable Care Act and call out the provisions that will impact independent business owners, such as what plans you can purchase, your options for obtaining health insurance, and an explanation of the Advance Premium Tax Credit. This guide is intended to help sort through the volume of words and provide you with information that you care about.

Meghan Moul, a Consultant Services Advisor for MBO Partners, recounts a recent MBO Associate’s transition into independence – defining a new way to retire in the process.


“Retirement isn’t what it used to be. In post-recession America, many would-be retirees are finding either a need or a desire to re-enter the workforce. Independent consulting provides a channel for those highly-skilled workers to help secure their retirement accounts.”


You probably don’t need me to tell you that over the past 5 years, retirement plans have been altered for many Americans. As a result, I’ve seen more and more retirement-age knowledge workers seeking out ways to keep income rolling in without the stress and constraints of 9-to-5 employment.

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. How does MBO affect my legal status?

A. Instead of choosing the route of self-incorporation, you can work within one of MBO’s services and receive the same limited liability protections you would have if you set up an LLC or S Corp. You will also pay yourself on a W-2, versus multiple 1099s, making you more attractive to lenders when applying for any type of loan or mortgage.

Based on our 25+ year history, financial strength and extensive insurance coverage, we can qualify you as a vendor to work with large companies. If MBO already has an agreement in place with a client you&apos;re interested in consulting with, you can avoid the time and effort required to establish a direct vendor status.

TESTIMONIAL
&quot;MBO really lets me combine convenience and benefits of W-2 employment with the luxury of being an independent. With MBO I have the freedom to work for whatever client I want, wherever I want. With everything they offer, I’m convinced that the nominal fee MBO charges is one of the best investments I can make in my independent career.”
