MBO Partners helps independent contractors get to work quickly and easily - even with the biggest and most complex clients.

Once you have your contract, MBO can guide you through the entire process, from insurances to making sure all that paperwork is done correctly.

Check out this story &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/CSA-Story-July_2013.pdf&gt; about a consultant who was able to leverage MBO to get to work with a dream client in the Fortune 100.
