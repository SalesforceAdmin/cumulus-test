Thank you for spreading the word about MBO Partners to {{lead.First Name}}.  Within the next five years, according to our Second Annual State of Independence Study &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/docs/2012-MBO_Partners_State_of_Independence_Report.pdf&gt;, the projected future size of independent workers is expected to rise to 23 million.
