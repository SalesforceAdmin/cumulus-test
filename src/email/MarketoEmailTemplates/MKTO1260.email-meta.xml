Thank you so much for sending this over. Is this something they want you to sign or MBO to sign? Usually our consultants sign this document as they are the ones privy to the material that the client doesn’t want disclosed. Just let me know.   I am excited to review the standard contract terms to let you know if MBO could work within them.  Yes, if we review the agreement and are able to execute it this would enable others to use MBO with this client as well.  Thanks Macon,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: MBO Call Follow Up Hi Sara, Thank you for preparing the additional calculations.  Attached is NII&apos;s NDA.  Once I have signed NDA, my NII manager indicated that I may share with you the standard contract terms used by consulting firms as well as by SoloW2 for your internal review and approval process.  You mentioned that you work with individuals; are you also able to work with corporations to become an approved &quot;preferred vendor&quot;?  This would theoretically enable others to also choose between MBO or SoloW2.  Regards, Macon On Wed, Apr 18, 2012 at 6:09 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Hi Macon, Ok I got it, sorry for the confusion.

Subject: Re: MBO Call Follow Up Hi Sara, Sorry I&apos;m just not following yet. :-) If We put in 65% instead of 80%, does that calculate less  retirement?  I need at least $5000 in net post-retirement cash income.  Thanks!

The 401(k) estimation tool doesn’t work that way, you need to let me know the total percentage you would like to be contributed and then I will do the math to find out what the employee deferral will need to be so the match and the deferral equal add up to that total percentage.
