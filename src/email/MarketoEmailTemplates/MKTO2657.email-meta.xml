HOW TO TRANSITION FROM TRADITIONAL W-2 EMPLOYMENT TO INDEPENDENT CONSULTING
There has never been a better time to become an independent consultant. In fact, nearly 17 million U.S. workers have embarked upon the path to date. It is a heady time in the U.S. workforce landscape, with many options for pursuing your passion. We know from the  MBO Partners Independent Workforce Index, the first-ever study of independent professionals in America, that the cataclysmic workforce shifts of the past decades have fueled a new kind of productivity, wealth and personal growth opportunity for American workers and companies. We also know that the majority of those who chose the independent path are very satisfied and plan to continue working as an independent.

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. How does MBO make it easier for me to work with a large client?
A. If you have Fortune 1,000 enterprise firms as your clients, you will find it easier and more seamless to win projects if your client is aware you are set up in our program. Since 1986, MBO has been establishing working relationships with many prestigious organizations, including more than half of the top Fortune 50 companies. We make it easy for our consultants to leverage those relationships to find opportunities.
Additionally, based on our 25+ year history, financial strength and extensive insurance coverage, we can qualify you as a vendor to work with large companies. If MBO already has an agreement in place with a client you&apos;re interested in consulting with, you can avoid the time and effort required to establish a direct vendor status.

TESTIMONIAL
&quot;On my first contracting job, I received a 1099 and thought I could handle it. I ended up owing the IRS plenty of money. I even considered hiring an accountant at a ridiculous rate to handle payroll and tax issues. It&apos;s so much easier to know that MBO is handling it all for me.&quot;
