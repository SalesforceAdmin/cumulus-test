Congratulations! Now you should respond to her and introduce me to her via email. I will then reach out to her by phone and explain our process.  You can say something like 
 
“At this point in the process I would like to introduce you to my back office, MBO Partners, who handles all the billing for me. Sara Conde will be reaching out to you.”
 
 So excited for you Russell!

Russell – I spoke with Property Management and they would like to do Option B for now at all downtown buildings during Earth Week and we will consider Option A for future.  The presentations would be 1 hour (including Q&amp;A) and over lunch time between 12pm and 1pm.  We will find a tenant conference space to use for the presentations at each building, so they won’t be in the main lobby space.   Can you provide an agenda outlining the major topics to be discussed during your presentations?
 
We would also like to do this at another commercial office building in Maryland, 1101 Wootton Parkway.  Would you be able to do this for Maryland based on Montgomery County and City of Rockville regulations too?  We can’t do single stream here in Montgomery County, unfortunately, so that is a big difference with our D.C. buildings.
 
Please let me know.
 
Thanks!
 
Eugenia.
