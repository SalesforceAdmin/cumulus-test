Subject: MBO Partners John/Trina, You mentioned MBO Partners and after review of their capabilities, I would like to go through them to work this project.  Sara Conde is my point of contact there.  As I understand it, I then don’t have to do the W-9 or I-9 with OCI.  I expect that I still need to sign all the other documents.  Is that correct? Thanks for all your help. Ted Buis240-401-4727 cell </textOnly>
