I’m glad to hear you want to move forward with MBO!  The next steps will be for you to send the contract to me to look over and I will then negotiate the contract on your behalf and send any requested changes to the client.  Have you told them about MBO Partners and how we will be working with them?  If not you might want to give them a heads up that I will be reaching out to them in the near future.  I will also send you a link to enroll in our system and you will follow the link, fill out the online enrollment paperwork and at the end once you have signed the GSA, there will be an enrollment packet that you will print off that has an I-9 form in it.  You will take that to a local notary and have them sign as an authorized representative in section 2 of the document and fax or email that back to me(or if you happen to be in the Herndon, VA area you can bring it in to our office and I will sign it).
 
Once you have enrolled and the contract is signed, I will be able to activate your MBO account and will give you instructions for time and expense entry so you can begin billing the client.
 
Please reach out to me if you have any additional questions and the sooner we get the contract negotiation process going the better chance we have of completing it by next week!
 
Have a great day,
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette,
 
Sorry I was out of touch last week.   I was wrapping up my last week of work and working on a possible contracting opportunity.  I received the paperwork (an NDA and contract) this morning, so I think I&apos;d like to go ahead and move forward with MBO&apos;s services ASAP. I&apos;d ideally like to start on the new project a week from today. 
 
Can you let me know what the next steps are?
 
Milena
