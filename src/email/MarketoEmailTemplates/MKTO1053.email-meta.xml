    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Maddam}},

Join me on {{my.date2:default=edit me}} to learn how to calculate your bill rate -- or hourly rate for services. In this hour-long webinar, you will see an overview of the possible approaches to calculating your bill rate. Then, you will learn step-by-step directions on the cost-based pricing method.

{{my.title:default=edit me}} also will include the story of a real-life MBO associate&apos;s approach to calculating the right personal rate.

Join us on {{my.date2:default=edit me}}, from 12:30-1:30 pm EST.
