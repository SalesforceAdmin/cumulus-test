Subject: Re: SES LLC Consulting What I wanted you to do was to work with Sara to get all your paperwork in order with MBO Partners so that when an ACCESS project looks viable for bid, the paperwork is done and we can hit the ground running. It would also be good for you to send me a recent photo so that I can put your summary resume and the photo on our SES LLC website www.seniorexecutiveservices.com &lt;http://www.seniorexecutiveservices.com&gt;.  Nothing actually kicks in until we get you a consulting project.Paul Shahady

MBO Partners does all of the back office billing and support for SES LLC. They provide the required business liability insurance and other (optional) services like 401K, health insurance, etc. All of my active consultants are actual employees of MBO Partners. They get a W-2 at the end of the year. MBO Partners provides an online system to log in time against a project and attach short notes describing what the consultant did for the client for those hours spent. There is also an upload capability to upload briefings, final reports etc. MBO Partners then invoices the client monthly and when the client pays, the consultant&apos;s payment is electronally deposited to the consultant&apos;s bank account. The Wright-Patterson AFB ACCESS contract I spoke with you about is actually with MBO Partners. We did that because MBO Partners can maintain the consultants&apos; security clearances. If I got you a consulting project under ACCESS, you would have to use the MBO Partners process. That&apos;s why I gave them your resume and asked them to contact you. For most of our industy consulting where we find the job for the consultant, the consultant decides what he or she wants to charge, for example $200.00 per hour. Out of the consultant&apos;s $200.00 per hour, MBO Partners charges 5% and also withholds federal taxes . SES LLC adds $25.00 per hour to the industry client&apos;s bill. Bottom line looks like this: Client gets charged $225.00 per hour for consultant servicesConsultant gets $200.00 per hour - 5%Consultant&apos;s bank account gets $200.00 per hour - 5% - Federal WithholdingSES LLC gets $25.00 per hour In dealing with the ACCESS contract, the situation is different. The consultants agree to take whatever rate it takes to win the contract. Our current bid rates are $125.00 per hour and $225.00 per hour with the consultants&apos; portion being $100 per hour - 5% and $200.00 per hour - 5%. Our experience with ACCESS so far is that we have to come in at the lower rate to win, because right now the government is only using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  Paul Shahady
