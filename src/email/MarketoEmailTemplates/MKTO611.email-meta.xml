Hi Steve,
Happy New Year.
 
Thanks again for talking with me while you were out sick.  The info was very useful and the meeting went well.  
I am in the process of reviewing their requirements and plan to start developing  a proposal in the next few weeks.  
I will connect with you at that time.  I plan to review the web casts you referenced, thanks for the resource.
 
Regards,
Dave.

Hello Dave,

I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?

Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one:

MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, there’s real hard facts about The State of Independence in America that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent. 
Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Steve
