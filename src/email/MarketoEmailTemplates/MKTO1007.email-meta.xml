Subject: Re: MBO Partners Call Follow Up Hi Sara, Thank you for the email. I did have a couple of questions. 
	- The 401K plan has a limit of 50,500 per year. My colleague mentioned it is much lower, aroun 17,500 per year. Can you tell me how there is such a large difference? The maximum is 17k a year on the personal side (traditional W-2.) On the business or matching side it’s 33k. When you combine the 33k with the 17.5k you get 50,500. To summarize,  a traditional W-2 employee can only contribute 17k into retirement and then the employer will match based on their plan. With MBO you match yourself so you can fully maximize. 	- Crescent will not be billed for my expenses, and I was looking at the list of NON billable expenses on your site, and did not see travel, meals, etc. Would this still apply? Yes, those are all acceptable categories with MBO. If you look at the link I sent you it will list commonly expense items as well as our expense policy.
 Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
Thanks!SaraRegards,
Sumit On Thu, Feb 16, 2012 at 12:55 PM, Sara Conde &lt; &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sconde@mbopartners.com&gt; wrote:Dear Sumit , It was a pleasure speaking with you.  You’ll find everything that I referenced on our call by going here. We are also promoting our new meet the independents project and are taking applications if you would like to be featured.  You can view the program by going here.  I will follow up with you as promised, should you have questions before then, please schedule a convenient time using my online schedule. Best regards,Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
