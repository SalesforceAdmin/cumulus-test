I just received your voicemail – sorry for the delay.  I was at an conference event in the city yesterday.  We currently do not take credit card payment.  We plan on changing this in about 6 months, but for now – we cannot.
 
I hope his answers your question.  Let me know if you need any additional help.
 
Steve

That makes sense and my associate number is C. Crane (Associate ID: 8603).  The question I now have is more fundamental, GS-23F-0087V is for Financial Services and Business Solutions, and when I researched SIN 520-15 I didn&apos;t see where it allowed for the types of services I offer, which are listed on the capability statement I provided.  Need to know if I&apos;m missing something and this schedule does cover my services or does MBO Partners have another GSA Schedule that supports the kind of work I do (Human Capital, Coaching, Leadership Development, etc.)

Thanks for your help.
Reggie

Reggie,
 
Sorry I just missed your call. I am on the phone at the moment.  You will be assigned an Associate number once you are a member with MBO and you can use that member ID number on your proposal. 
 
Your member id number is not assigned until you create your account with us.  I will send you the link so you can do this and then you’ll see the Member id next to your name.

Thanks for sending this Steve, but it doesn&apos;t get me to the answer I&apos;m seeking.  I will contact the contracting office here tomorrow and if you would let me know when you&apos;ve had a chance to speak with Dave it would be great appreciated.

Reggie,
 
This might help.  This PowerPoint outlines the steps that one of our clients follows when using our GSA Schedule.
