I just spoke with him. He is going to call you to ensure you want to use our program and if so, he said he will work on a contract with us. I also let him know we would be happy to work with their agreement if he was more comfortable with that. Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: Intratek Computer, Inc_Daniel Buchanan_MBO Agreement Hi Sara, At this point, it may be helpful for you to reach out to him by phone and see if you can help clarify MBO Partners&apos; role in this contract. I&apos;m not exactly sure why there is confusion over this, or why Bahi is holding up my contract work over my insurance coverage that is being handled on my end and does not impact his business or the assigned work in any way, but I will continue to try to track him down for an answer. Please let me know if you have any luck reaching him. Thanks,Daniel Buchanan

Subject: Re: Intratek Computer, Inc_Daniel Buchanan_MBO Agreement Hi Sara, Thank you for following up. I&apos;ve received one email back from Bahi since your introduction to MBO Partners&apos; suite of services, which he didn&apos;t seem to have a clear understanding of. I sent him a couple of emails last week in response, reiterating the information from your email and explaining how I would be utilizing your services for insurance coverage and benefits throughout the term of my contract with Intratek Computer. Unfortunately, I still haven&apos;t received a reply from him and have had no luck tracking him down by phone. I will continue to try connecting with him today and keep you posted. Kind regards,Daniel Buchanan
