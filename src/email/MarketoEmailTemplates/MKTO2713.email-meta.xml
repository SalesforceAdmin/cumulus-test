There is still time to register for MBO&apos;s August 29 webinar, Understanding the Contractor: 5 Challenges ICs Have with Your Enterprise &lt;info.mbopartners.com/Aug29Webinar-Challenges.html&gt;. Two of our own Associates, Robert Weber and David Shekari, longtime consultants with major corporate clients, will join me, Jay Lash, to explain the IC&apos;s perspective on common issues that arise when consulting with a large enterprise. 

Whether you are responsible for all of your enterprise consultants or you engage these resources to help you accomplish your work, you will hear what is important to these people and improve your position as a â€œclient of choice.&quot;
