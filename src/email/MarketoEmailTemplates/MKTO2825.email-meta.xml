The last step is logging into MBO Access &lt;https://access.mbopartners.com/&gt; and completing the “Industry Expertise” and “Disciplines” sections of your profile. This information needed for our workmen’s comp. policy and must be completed before I can activate your account and get you billing.  Your user ID and password is the same as your MBO Business Center. Please let me know if you have any questions.
