The Gen X Report &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/independent-workforce-index.html&gt; is the latest phase of our bellwether independent workforce index and illuminates the motivations and challenges of America’s 5.9 million Gen X independent workers. “More than any other generation, Gen X independents provide insight into how independence is shaping a new mindset and approach to the way we work,” said Gene Zaino, CEO of MBO Partners.
