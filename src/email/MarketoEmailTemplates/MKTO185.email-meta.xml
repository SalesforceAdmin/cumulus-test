I have not heard anything from Marstel Day at this point.  I will send a follow up email requesting a status update on where they are in reviewing our MSA.  Please let me know if there is any other action you would like for me to take or if you have any additional information.
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Nicolette,
 
OK, I had a substantial conversation with Marstel Day this morning. It appears that they will want to establish a working consultative relationship with me. 
 
Juli MacDonald Winbush will be the point of contact for Marstel Day with MBO Partners.
 
I&apos;ve completed the enrollment process and signed the agreement. The proverbial ball is now in your court. Please advise if I can answer any questions that might arise.
 
Regards,
 
John
