    <subject>Ready to charge $300 an hour? Visit MBO’s new and improved bill rate calculator and guide</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Consultant}},

I noticed that you have visited our bill rate calculator &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/#billrate&gt; and I wanted to share the news that we have made some updates to it in case you wanted to take a fresh look. Perhaps it’s time to re-assess your hourly rate, or set a new one?

In case you don’t already have it, here’s the link to download our free 20-page Bill Rate Resource Guide &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/files/pdfs/mbo-bill-rate-resource-guide.pdf&gt;. I hope that the material is helpful to you in determining an appropriate consulting bill rate to charge clients.

Additionally, this spring we launched our popular, free monthly Independent Consulting Brief &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independent-consulting-brief&gt;. Sign-up today!

Regards,
 {{lead.EM FName:default=Steve}}
