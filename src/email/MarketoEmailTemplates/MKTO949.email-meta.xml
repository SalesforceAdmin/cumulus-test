I have worked for one firm that would only use me as a 1099 contractor.  That said, the other role I was looking at with Infozen (you sent them paperwork), fell through when my primary contact left the company.  I have started to look at permanent opportunities, hence the delay in billing services through you.  I still may require your services at some point, since some of these roles could start in a consulting capacity.  Thank you for following up with me, and hopefully I can stay in your system for the next 6 months or so as I work my way through things.
