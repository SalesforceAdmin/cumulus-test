    <textOnly>Hello,

Are you planning to attend the Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA) Contingent Workforce Risk Forum or CW Summit coming up in September?

These conferences offer HR, Procurement, and Legal executives a unique opportunity to explore today&apos;s best practices for engaging independent contractors (ICs) safely and economically. Whatever your need - mitigating risk, improving processes, increasing visibility, or simply learning about IC issues you may not have considered - some of the industry&apos;s leading experts will be on hand to help.

The details:

Contingent Workforce Risk Forum
September 18-19, 2012 | Hilton Bayfront, San Diego, CA
www.cwriskforum.com 

Contingent Workforce Strategies Summit
September 20-21, 2012 | Hilton Bayfront, San Diego, CA
www.cwssummit.com 

MBO Enterprise Solutions is sponsoring these conferences and will host special thought leadership sessions on the latest trends in IC engagement and risk mitigation. We&apos;re also setting up private consultations with contract labor attorney Eric Rumbaugh, Partner with Michael, Best &amp; Friedrich, LLP. If you&apos;re interested in a meeting, please let me know and I will send you more details.

If you are not attending but would like an executive briefing on the latest trends in IC risk and engagement best practices, simply reply to this message and we&apos;ll coordinate a time that will work for your schedule.

Between the great location and the agenda, the CW Risk Forum and the CW Summit promise to be the best conferences of the season. If you aren&apos;t involved with IC engagements at your company, please consider forwarding this message to the appropriate person.

Thanks for your time.

Best regards,
Steve
