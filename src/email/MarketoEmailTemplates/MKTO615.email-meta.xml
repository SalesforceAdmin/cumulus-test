We do, but the business model is more than just payroll services for IC’s.  We provide an alternative to self incorporation for independent consultants.  I have attached a link to a PDF below for you to review and if you have additional questions about the model and how our program works I would be happy to have a conversation with you about it.

Thank you and have a great day,
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette,

Does MBO allow self employed consultants to use MBO for invoicing and payments?

Thanks!

Bill
