Welcome to MBO!  
 
I wanted to share some basic time and expense entry instructions with you.  Schedule a time that works for you and we can walk through your Business Center by going here https://my.timedriver.com/C9CPC.  Below you’ll find some general information should you want to investigate some of this on your own prior to our call.
 
Login to https://app1.mbopartners.com, using the username/password created by you.
 
Time:
1.)   Click on “time” located at the top of the screen
2.)   Select the appropriate week from the drop down menu, enter your time and click save
*make sure you have an entry for each day Monday through Friday - even if that entry is a “0” for a holiday or non-worked day* 
3.)   To submit your time at the end of each week, check the “email” box to the right of your days before selecting “log hours and email selected”
4.)   Continue to add hours each week as described above and that’s it!
 
Expenses:
Click on “expenses” located at the top of the screenClick on “add a new expense”Select the appropriate expense type from the list on the rightEnter in the required details (all fields marked with an asterisk)Upload receipt if necessary Click “save”; if the expense appears in Green you’re all set, if it appears in Orange you need to upload a receipt and if it appears in Black then you are missing information and you need to re-checkIf you prefer not to upload your receipt click on the tab labeled “Expense Report.”  This will create a cover sheet for your expenses 
Along with the cover sheet please fax (703-793-6070) or email (doc@mbopartners.com) all receipts to MBO. If you email please copy me as 
well.
 
Again, I would like to welcome you to MBO.  If you would like a brief tour of your account with us, I would be more than happy to do so and we can answer any questions that you may have along the way.  Simply let me know of a good time to speak and I will reach out.
I look forward to working with you!
 
Steve
