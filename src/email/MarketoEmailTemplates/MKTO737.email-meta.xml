You are most welcome – good to hear from you. That is a great question. From a legal perspective, yes, the contract is between MBO and the client but you own the relationship and we do not recruit or staff so we would not use your client for the purpose. We do this so we are able to list them as holder on our policy for professional insurances, have the ability to receive and collect funds, and most importantly, to limit your liability.  
 
That being said, you may down play your relationship with MBO when speaking with your client as someone who merely handles your “back office paperwork” and let them know that I will be in contact. Also, we have our legal  team review the contract and redline anything that may not be in your best interest (such as large net payment terms, invoicing frequency, termination clauses, indemnity etc.) we would always send this to you before sending it to your client and you would be copied on all communications to the client during the contracting process.
 
If you feel totally uncomfortable with this there is an option where MBO doesn’t have a contract with your client and you maintain legal ownership. If that is something that appeals to you we would need you to sign this form and we could move forward.
 
I would love to speak to you about this in more detail.  Pelase feel free to schedule a time to speak with me by clicking, here or by reaching out to me directly on the line listed below. If you would like me to reach out to you directly please provide me with your phone number and I will be happy to do so.
 
Thank you!
Sara

Dear Sara,
Thanks for taking the time to follow up my interest in the services offered by MBO Partners.
To provide some context, I am in the process of assessing several business opportunities one of which is becoming an consultant.
Must admit that initially, MBO offer looked very appealing however, learning that the contractual relationship with my customers is actually through MBO was a bit discouraging.
 
Would you mind clarifying in this is indeed the case?
 
Many thanks
Fidel Benitez

Dear Fidel,
 
A few weeks ago you requested information regarding the services offered by MBO Partners.  Now might not be the right time for you.  Whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America. 
 
I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.
 
Are you working on a contract/project now or are you currently working W2 at the moment?
 
Best regards,
Sara
