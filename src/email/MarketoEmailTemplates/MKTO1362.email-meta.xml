I’ll be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services and answer any specific questions you may have.  I noticed that in your request for information you mentioned that you are looking for Disability Insurance.  I wanted to let you know that we are not an insurance provider, we actually provide back office support for independent consultants and if you work in our program then you are eligible to be on our group LTD Insurance plan.  As I previously mentioned, I would be happy to speak with you to tell you more about the program and you may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here.  You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube. I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners! Have a great day,Nicolette  ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
