Have you ever wondered how many other people are self-employed? What do they do, how much do they make, how many are women or men?
As the independent workforce grows in America, we continue to research the trend in our third annual State of Independence research report. Join MBO Partners&apos; CEO Gene Zaino as he hosts a discussion with Steve King and Carolyn Ockels, Partners at Emergent Research, breaking down the data, demographics and dollars related to the nation&apos;s fast-growing self-employed segment.
