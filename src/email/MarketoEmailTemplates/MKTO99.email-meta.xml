I have activated your account.  Between now and Monday you will want to go in and enter your expenses.  I sent you another email with those instructions – call me if you have questions.
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Hi Steve,
 
Attached is the signed, notarized I-9 form and a copy of my passport.  I will call you once I start inputting my expenses.  Were you going to send me instructions for that part?
 
Let me know if you need anything else at this time.
 
Thanks,
 
Tricia

Hi Steve,
 
Sorry for the delay . . . things have just been crazy between travel, work and having my 6-year old grandson for the summer (not much gets done when he’s around J).  I have FINALLY gone in and set up my account and now need to do the expense portion.  Can the money just sit in my business center until I am ready to invoice?  How does that work?
 
Maybe we can touch base on Monday to discuss.
 
Thanks for your patience!
 
Tricia

Tricia,
 
Unexpectedly, we received payment for you today for the work you did with EMP.  We however cannot pay you until you enroll in our system.  We will unfortunately have to send this money back to Atrium and wait for you to enroll, at which time we will request for them to repay the invoice we send.  
 
Can you please let me know when you plan to finish your enrollment?  If we can finish your enrollment today or Monday at the latest, we can have this deposited in your business center, but any longer and it will need to be sent back. 
 
I will call you as well.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
