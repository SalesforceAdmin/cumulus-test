    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued MBO Associate}},

It’s been a journey for MBO Partners to help the whole country see what we already know and admire about independent workers. That they are passionate about their work, satisfied and motivated. That they are committed to making a difference. That they are, in fact, leaders in the new workforce. 

I couldn’t be more happy to share with you our recent release of the inaugural landmark MBO Partners Independent Workforce Index (http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/landmark-national-study-reveals-millions-join-new-age-career-independence-surprising-1557357.htm). I encourage you to visit our newly launched State of Independence site (http://info.mbopartners.com/stateofindependence), and see the positive results; you may also enjoy viewing this story graphic about the study (http://info.mbopartners.com/whoaretheindependents?) – a real silver lining in what is otherwise a gloomy jobs   
picture in our nation today. It’s all thanks to you, the independents! 

You also may enjoy following our team at a new Facebook State of Independence page (http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-State-of-Independence/126879364075991), where you can read blogs and comments from other independents and workforce experts reacting to the study. This is just the beginning of yearlong campaign at MBO Partners to promote the real story about independent work in America – one piece of data, one consultant, one story and one opportunity at a time. Please jump into the conversation. 

Thank you for choosing to work with MBO Partners. We are honored to support you, the pioneering independent. 

Will you also join me in declaring this as the year of career independence? Declare (http://info.mbopartners.com/declare.html)

Keep up the great work!

Best regards,
