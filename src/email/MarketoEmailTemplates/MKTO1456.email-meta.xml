Subject: Old Referrals in the System / Need to be reassigned Hey Guys, We need to split these leads in the system.  Sara if you can take the top half and Nicolette if you can take the bottom half. These are old referrals that were automatically switched to my name from old enrollment managers.  The records were never managed in Salesforce, but they were uploaded into SF at some time in one of our sync’s.  The lead status needs to change to Not Interested – Stopped Responding in both Salesforce and MBO System.  The lead owner and enrollment manager needs to be updated to your name. As a last ditch effort, please send them the enclosed email to introduce yourself, but keep them in Not Interested – Stopped Responding unless they respond. Please give me an ETA, would like to have this updated before the next report goes out to the exec team on next Friday. Steve  Michellle Erskin9/26/11ProspectCompanyReferred by CompanyMicrosoft CorporationMicrosoft CorporationSteve ArhancetMelodie DeWitt5/17/12ProspectReferralReferred by AssociateJulia K.
