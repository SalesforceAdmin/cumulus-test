1)      Who do we work with? 
We work with independent consultants who have an established clientele, as well as those considering venturing out to launch a new consulting business.2)      Whats our mission?Its pretty simple  we make it easy for independent consultants and their clients to work together by handling the administrative, financial, legal, tax and expense burdens that bog down consultants, thus increasing their billable time. In addition, we provide them access to the largest exclusive online community of successful independent consultants, the clients that engage with them, and a multitude of valuable resources.
3)      What solutions do we provide?

·         Explain our services in more detail, and more specifically how we can help you

·         Provide you access to a multitude of resources catered to independent consultants and their needs
