Subject: Request for Information on your firm Good morning Sara, I got your contact information from Harry Parsons. I met him at Novartis where he is contracting.I would like to speak with you regarding the possibility of joining MBO Partners.  Currently I am in a temporary position until May2nd. I will have the opportunity of joining QSC as a contractor.  This would be my first experience with this type of work and I think going with your company to  handling my account looks very appealing. I do have lots of questions and need explanations of how your firm works. Can we set up a time to talk this week, this way I can get away to a private spot.I am available tomorrow from 8 to 2:30 and Friday 8-4 or after 5pm both days. I look forward to speaking with you. Ana DominguezQuality and Compliance Proffesional, Pharma </textOnly>
