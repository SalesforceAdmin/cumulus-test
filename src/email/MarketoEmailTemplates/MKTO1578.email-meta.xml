Subject: Re: MBO Call Summery Sara, Thank you for YOUR time yesterday. Although Ive not had the opportunity to view the webinars yet, I have gone through all of the documents and weblinks you forwarded to me yesterday.  That being said, I have a few more questions. 1. Although I am slightly familiar with the process of the federal govt hiring a contractor to perform a particular mission  and the associated paperwork - I suspect what little I know is just about enough to get me into trouble! That being the case, can you pls explain to me how the process would work with MBO in the middle?  For example, and I believe the first step is for the client (in this case, the fed govt agency) to generate a RFP.  Assuming that is the first step, how does the process proceed from there?  Does MBO do the negotiating with the client, as well as all of the official paperwork required (contracts, SOWs, etc)?  In essence, Im asking about all of the things that go on behind the scenes with the small contractor Im working with now. I just show up to work every morning and do my job. I dont know much about the official paperwork which allows me to do my job unhindered by administrative issues  thats something the contractor I work for does. Great question. MBO doesnt not do any rate negation, we come in to handle all the vender requiems and set up documentation. We can provide an official RFP from MBO to the agency for our services (see example above.)  2. I have and will continue to need a SECRET-level clearance to perform the work Im doing.  How does that add to the equation?  Additional administrative requirements?  Additional costs? There is an additional 1% added to our service to hold a clearance.  3.  In looking over the MBO Cash Flow Estimate you emailed me yesterday (the one with no expenses, and assuming approx. 100K salary), and comparing it with my most recent pay stub, there are some disparities I hope you might be able to explain: -          My current Direct Salary per month is 8166 (all numbers in dollars), which works out to approx 98K/year. From that yearly amount, deductions are made as follows (per year): fed withholding 18720, state withholding 3600, social security 4128, Medicare 1440, state disability 1128. On the MBO Cash Flow Estimate (no expenses, assume 100K/year salary), I see fed withholding to be 15,218, state withholding 3918, social security 4222, medicare 1457, and city/local/other withholding 759. All the numbers seem pretty close between what is witheld now versus what is projected with MBO, except for state and fed withholding.  Can you explain the difference? Also, what does city/local/other withholding specifically refer to? And I dont see state disability in the Personal Taxes and Witholding&quot; section. Where is that? The difference is likely a result of the frequency calculation that our estimator tool is using. It is assuming you are making this amount every month while your pay stubs are calculating bi-weekly. If you want to send me a copy of your pay stub I will use an outside calculator www.paycheckcitty.com &lt;http://www.paycheckcitty.com&gt; to contrast and compare. The city, local, or other withholding is based on a locality tax in RI. Again, if you give me a copy of your pay stub I will use and outside calculator to contrast and compare. There is no state disability tax in RI thats what it is listed as 0% N/A in the Business Center Payroll Tax Breakdown. -          From the Use of Business Center Funds section I see the MBO Service Fee of 5856, which is the 5 percent cut for MBO, correct?  Yes.  What does the 10,730.12 under Business Center Payroll tax represent?  It represents the payroll taxes you are responsible for in the program, you can see a breakdown of this in Business Center Payroll Tax Breakdown on the center right. All the calculations are based off of your W-2 gross pay. Does the Business Center Payroll Tax Breakdown refer to the 10,730.12, and is that all of the costs which an employer pays, and which I don&apos;t see anywhere on my current pay stub because it&apos;s something my employer pays? Yes.  What Is State DBL? Is is a state disability tax which companies in some states need to make, but which in Rhode Island is not required? Yes. Again,  thank you for your time yesterday, and I look forward to working with you! Of course any time, I look forward to working with you as well!! Jim From: Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt;
