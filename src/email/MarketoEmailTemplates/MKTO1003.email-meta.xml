Unfortunately we are only structured to work in the United States. Additionally, we do not do any type of job placement but rather handle the back office administration for consultants once they have a project. Good luck in your search!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e:  &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&quot;&gt;sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
