Subject: RE: MBO Webinar March 2nd: Invitation to Be a Panelist Hi Steve, I am honored to be considered for this, and very much appreciate you reaching out. Normally, I wouldn’t hesitate to say “yes,” but unfortunately I will need to decline this time. This date conflicts with a meeting that I have at Johns Hopkins University. I am the Treasurer for the university’s alumni association and we have an all-day executive committee session on March 2nd that I cannot miss.  Please do keep me in mind for future webinars. Thank you, -J Jesse D.

Subject: MBO Webinar March 2nd: Invitation to Be a Panelist Dear Jesse, MBO is kicking off the next phase of a series to educate current and aspiring independent consultants and we’d like to ask for your help. You were identified to me as someone who could add value our upcoming series on Bill Rates for Consultants.  I am pleased to ask you to join me as an associate panelist in a Webinar that MBO is hosting March 2, 2012 at 12:30 – 1:30.  You should be able to do this virtually from your own home or work location. The topic of the webinar is “How to Calculate Your Consulting Rate: Making the Transition from W-2 to 1099.”  How the Webinar works: ·         For the first 30 minutes I will walk the audience through the most common method of bill rate calculation: the cost-based method·         For the remaining 30 minutes, we’d like to share firsthand stories from current associates about the process they used to arrive at their bill rate. During this second portion, we’ll call on our panelists to share stories and reactions, including you! What would I be committing to?·         If you are willing to contribute, we will schedule an initial call to go over the logistics, which should last about 30 minutes·         The webinar itself will take an hour, but you are welcome to join at the half-hour mark if you have other commitments that day, leading to a total commitment of about 1-1.5 hours Read more about the webinar  &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9amVzc2VAZW1lcmdlbnRjb25zdWx0YW50cy5jb20mdWlkPTAmZXh0cmE9TVRReWZITnlZMmxrUFRrMmZHMWhhV3hwWkQxaFltVmtZVFUyWlMwelpUTTFMVFEwTWpZdE9UbGhNQzB4TVRJek1qUmlOakF6WldVdE9UWjhabkp2YlQxellYSm9ZVzVqWlhSQWJXSnZjR0Z5ZEc1bGNuTXVZMjl0ZkhOMVltbzlUVUpQSUZkbFltbHVZWElnVFdGeVkyZ2dNbTVrT2lCSmJuWnBkR0YwYVc5dUlIUnZJRUpsSUdFZ1VHRnVaV3hwYzNRPT0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;http://info.mbopartners.com/Calculating-Bill-Rates.html?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCcVRKpkJW7vGcMK7okSHDdZa7rrBpCPnywYE91kUUGIalUg%3D%3D&quot;&gt;here. We hope you will consider joining an important discussion and positioning yourself as a seasoned professional in  your community.  I look forward to hearing from you and would be happy to connect you with my colleague Jaime Buckley who can help answer any additional logistics or content questions for you leading up to the day of the Webinar itself.  Regards, Steve___________________________________Steve ArhancetDirector, Consultant ServicesMBO Partners t: 703.793.6011f: 703.793.6081m: 540.560.8837e: sarhancet@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
