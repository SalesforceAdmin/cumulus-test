Our Security department usually doesn’t come in to play until we receive a DD-254 from your client. If you have questions about the process you can find those details here &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Security_Clearance_Info_Sheet_Generic.pdf&gt;. Otherwise, you may connect with them at security@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:security@mbopartners.com&gt;  It was wonderful meeting you last week and I would love to continue our conversation. You may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here &lt;https://my.timedriver.com/8SLYS&gt;.  You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube &lt;http://youtu.be/zKDzwSTmGv4&gt;. I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners! Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
