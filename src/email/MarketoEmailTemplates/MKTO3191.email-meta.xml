Research is the strongest tool we have to grow awareness around America’s independent movement. That’s why MBO Partners is teaming up with the Career Advisory Board (CAB) to conduct a short, 10 question survey &lt;https://mbopartners.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_0Bdwv1X6ccVMMkd&gt; to better understand the skills and personal attributes needed to be a successful independent contractor or consultant.

Here’s where you come in – if you can help us by taking our 5 minute survey here &lt;https://mbopartners.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_0Bdwv1X6ccVMMkd&gt;, we will enter you to win a 16GB Apple iPad.

Your responses will be used by the CAB to provide advice and counsel to students, young adults and others who are considering a career as an independent professional. 

We appreciate you taking the time to give back. As an experienced and successful independent professional, your input will be a valuable asset to those starting on this path.

Thank you in advance for your help.
