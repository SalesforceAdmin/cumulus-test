Thanks so much for the feedback.  If their client’s preference has to do with needing to pay a small business MBO is classified as a small business so we could easily meet that preference/requirement for them.  Additionally, consultants can always hold the legal agreement if they (or their client) prefer. We would just ask that they sign this form &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Contract_Acknowledgement_Form.pdf&gt; so they are aware of the risks of MBO not holding the contract.  The client would also have to be comfortable making payment to MBO without a contract. I hope these things address some of the concerns, please let me know if you have any additional questions.  We so appreciate your referrals!  Have a lovely holiday Joel, Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Hi Sara:

This is a good idea and good program. I wish  you and MBO a lot of success with it and will try to participate as well. 

On that note, when I&apos;ve referred some small business colleagues to MBO regarding their looking for people to help on projects, I sometimes get a response that &quot;they prefer to be able to get bills from individual consultants and pay individual consultants instead of sub contractors, which is how they view MBO. It has something to do with Small business innovative research grants (SBIR) and related small business contracts. I don&apos;t know if it is possible, but if you had a non-circumvent agreement with the appropriate clients and an agreement to have reimbursements/fees deposited into the clients MBO accounts, then could you circumvent this limitation and the consultant bill the company with MBO being the agent of the consultant. This might not enable the client to get certain benefits of working through MBO, but it might lead to more and easier business. 

all the best

From: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;Dear Joel,
I am thrilled to announce that we have recently launched a brand new Referral Program with some serious perks you will want to know about!  

Our greatest compliment is when an Associate like you spreads the word about us to friends and colleagues that would benefit from utilizing our services.  The projected future size of independent workers is expected to climb to 23 million within the next 5 years, so our mission is more important than ever- making it easy for independent consultants and their clients to do business together. 
We believe that no good deed should go unnoticed, which is why when you refer a friend, every referral you submit gives you a chance to win a home office makeover worth up to $5,000! *You will also be giving your friend the opportunity to try us for free. Finally, if your friend likes what we do, we will deposit $500 into your Business Center upon their enrollment and subsequent billings of $30,000. *Restrictions apply. See contest rules &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTI3OTYtMTAzNjQtMC0yMTE4LXByb2QtMTQ3MSZtZXNzYWdlaWQ9MCZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTE0NzEmc2VyaWFsPTEyOTk3MDEyNzcmZW1haWxpZD1qZHVib3dAbXNuLmNvbSZ1c2VyaWQ9NDEyMzEtMSZleHRyYT0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program/official-rules?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRokvKXPZKXonjHpfsX86u4uWLHr08Yy0EZ5VunJEUWy2oIARNQhcOuuEwcWGog8zQ5X&gt; for details.
