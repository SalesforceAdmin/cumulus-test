<p style="font-weight: normal;">
As I reflected on the quality of the peer group and the insightful nature of discussions last week at the Google SIG Silicon Valley Regional Roundtable, I felt fortunate to have participated. I&rsquo;ve been in the industry a long time, but still walked away with new understanding.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">There were a few perspectives and real-world experiences shared during the Roundtable that I found particularly helpful and interesting. In the spirit of continuing the momentum, and building our community, I wanted to share my list of take-aways. I look forward to hearing from others on their perspectives, both now and later. Let&rsquo;s keep in touch.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;">
<li><strong>Outsourcing is a way of life.&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;Outsourcing now includes small projects as well as complete business processes. It&rsquo;s not a spare limb. It&rsquo;s a part of the company DNA</li>
<li><strong>A SOW alone is not enough.</strong>&nbsp; SOWs are used to help manage IC engagements but it is difficult to package the work in a well-defined document that can be enforced and also captures the requirements for compliance</li>
<li><strong>A buffer is needed.&nbsp; </strong>With the number and type of possible engagements,<strong> </strong>there needs to be someone<strong> </strong>between the company and the independent contractor to make sure there is compliance during the entire engagement</li>
<li><strong>Oversight is paramount.</strong>&nbsp; There needs to be someone responsible for managing the workers relationship and assuring both payment and governance are followed properly.&nbsp; Independent Consultants can be advisory or event/milestone/deliverable based. That function can also be outsourced or a third party &ldquo;Aggregator&rdquo; of SOW projects can be used</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Workforce Solutions rule the day.</strong>&nbsp; Companies are not planning to go back to the headcount levels of the pre-recession times.&nbsp; Rather, they will be depending on contingent workers, project-based consultants and outsourced providers</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">This is what I gleaned from our discussion.&nbsp; Did I miss something important?&nbsp; I would welcome any additional thoughts or feedback you have about your experience and what really hit home for you.&nbsp;</p></span>
