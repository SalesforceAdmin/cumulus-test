Subject: Re: MBO Call Follow Up Hi Sara, Thanks for this! Is there any way to lower the non-billables to $200 (I can walk to work) and lower the retirement match to 15% (currently at 30%)? Thanks! Macon On Fri, Apr 13, 2012 at 3:11 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com&gt; wrote:Dear Macon , It was a pleasure speaking with you.  You’ll find everything that I referenced on our call by going here.
