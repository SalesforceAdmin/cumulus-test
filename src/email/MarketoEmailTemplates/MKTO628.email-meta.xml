Thank you for following up.  I apologize I will not have any time to follow up with you today, but will have a few minutes tomorrow morning or early next week that we can have a conversation and I hopefully can answer any questions you have for me.
 
I have included a link to my calendar below for you to schedule a convenient time that works for you and I hope to speak with you soon!

Have a great evening,
Nicolette
