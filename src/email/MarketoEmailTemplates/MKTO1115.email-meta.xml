I have let my team know we are ready to move forward. They will handle all communication and efforts with the agency. There is nothing more you need to do at this point. Thanks so much,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: collection - next steps Hello Sara, Sorry for the dealy... Please go ahead with collection through the collection agency. I understand the collection agency will receive 25% of whatever they recoup.  I do have several questions. Will the collection agency contact me directly, and if so do I have any input into the process. Thanks for your follow-up, I&apos;m sorry things had to end like this. Have a good week, Robert From: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;

Importance: High Hi Robert, Did you decide on how you wanted to move forward? If you want to move forward with the collection agency I will need an email authoring MBO to work with an outside collection agency acknowledging your understanding that they will recoup 25% of whatever they collect (as we discussed.) Please let me know. Thanks,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
