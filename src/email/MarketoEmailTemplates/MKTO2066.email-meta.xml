I have attached an estimate and I believe the best rate for you for this project would be $35 an hour (see attached.) It puts you under $14k W-2 but gives you a little bit of wiggle room if you end up working more. You can also, track your YTD gross pay in our system as well so you will know when you are getting close to 14k.  Looking forward to being introduced to Mike so we can get the paperwork in place, please let me know if you have any questions. Enjoy your flight today! Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; If you are in the DC area please check out our upcoming networking event! &lt;http://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/event?oeidk=a07e6cqaqtk0702919f&amp;llr=kp5x6qkab&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Billing rate  Sarah,Got the calculator and worked out the billing rate.  By my calcs the rate doesn’t include any taxes-social security, employment, medicare/Medicaid, etc –sooo.  Does MBO tack that onto the base billing rate and that is what my client is invoiced or ???  Pls have one of the consultant service advisors contact me, because I want to move on this as soon as possible with the latest opportunity we discussed.  Thank you for your help over the last several months…jvb</textOnly>
