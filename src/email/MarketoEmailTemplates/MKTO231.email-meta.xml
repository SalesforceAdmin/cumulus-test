Thank you for the inquiry you submitted at the MBO Partners website.  I wanted to introduce myself as the person at MBO Partners responsible for all new associate and partnership requests.  I received your voicemail and the confirmation of the appointment you scheduled with me on Monday and just wanted to say I look forward to speaking with you!
 
Have a great weekend,
 
Nicolette
