Can you resend with client signatures? I will make a note to check in with you on Friday about the State Order.  Thanks,

Subject: Morgan update Hi Sara,
 
My mgr just came back from vacation and there has been a mgr change so things are hectic. He has teh timesheets and I should have them signed this week. I wanted to know if I can fax them to you and would you be able to scan them in because I&apos;m having issues with my system?
 
Also the state will be sending you another order to only take out 424 for this upcoming pay period fo rthe end of July. I f you dont receive it by Friday,let me know and I&apos;ll have them fax it.
 
Thanks 
 
I&apos;ll keep you posted
