CEO CORNER

The Secrets to Writing the Perfect LinkedIn Profile

There&apos;s no avoiding it anymore; if you&apos;re an independent consultant, you need a LinkedIn profile - and a good one too. Your potential clients will google you before they even consider calling you to talk, and that initial hit on a search engine is the first part of the modern interview.

If your profile was hastily thrown together, that&apos;s no different than handing in an incomplete resume. More&gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/CEOCornerOctober2012.html&gt;
BOOK REVIEW

Dennis Kanegaye dishes on &quot;let&apos;s get real or let&apos;s not play&quot;

For independent consultants, identifying, qualifying and closing your next assignment can be a daunting, frustrating and sometimes frightening proposition- but it is an important and necessary part of your business success.

I have read many business development books over the years, but find myself going back to reading sections of &quot;Let&apos;s Get Real or Let&apos;s Not Play.&quot; More &gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/BookReviewDennisKanegayeOctober2012.html&gt;

MARKETING CORNER

Meet Independent reinhard Hillefeld of Connecticut

&quot;Working as an independent can mean different things to different people.  You need a certain temperament to do it successfully&quot;  says Reinhard Hillefeld, who worked at PepsiCo as a consultant for over 11 years, rising from a developer to a senior architect. When an unplanned sequence of events led him to become an independent contractor, he joined Oracle&apos;s Business Intelligence Consulting practice in NY. That was his first taste of the consulting world and he never looked back.  More &gt; &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/meet-the-independents-ct.php&gt;
