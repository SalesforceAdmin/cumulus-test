I saw your email about the NDA and your approval of the TO’s I will get those over to TASC right away and copy you.  We have worked with IBM in the past under our old name “MyBizOffice” we still have the same tax ID connected to it so there is no issue if they want to continue to work with us under our old name.  We don’t have anything with Boeing but it looks like we have reached out to them before. It may be harder to get in to these clients but we can certainly try! Thanks Mark!Sara From: Mark Clark [mailto:clarkmark7@gmail.com]

Subject: Re: FW: TO&apos;s for Mark Clark Sara: Sorry to be delayed in responding to this.  I have been on travel today and without access to my email.  Will review first thing in the morning and get you an answer.  However, the rate is correct - $200 per hour.  I just want to read the task verbiage closely since it&apos;s gone final. I will also fax the NDA back to TASC by COB Thursday.   This is good news.  Guess I should go on holiday more often.  :)) Thanks for your continued help!! New subject:  Does MBO have contracts/relationships with IBM and Boeing?  I also am getting feelers out from them. Best regards, MarkOn Wed, Aug 1, 2012 at 11:17 AM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Hi Mark, Please let me know if I have your permission to sign the attached.  Also please return the NDA to TASC when you get a moment, I believe they sent that to you in a separate email. 
Thanks!Sara From: Nicolette Taylor
