Subject: Re: MBO Partners Enrollment Information Filled out the first form, hit next and then it keeps asking me for my work phone but I do not have one. i entered my home phone but it doesn&apos;t like that as it keeps asking me to enter my work phone. I did get to the next page once by some miracle but it said something to the effect the file does not exist.

Using Firefox on Windows Vista.

Computers are dumb.
