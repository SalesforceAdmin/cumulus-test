Subject: Getting started again Miss Taylor,  Good morning.   I wanted to reach out and ask a couple questions of you.  I have been in the MBO system for a number of years but inactive for the last few.  I am now working on some projects as an independent consultant for a company in Texas and wanted to run my income as payroll through MBO.  Could you please provide me with the address and/or methodology for effacing such a transfer of funds?  They, the company, are looking for the correct way to transfer the funds.Thanks for your help.Sincerely, Leigh Anne Slate </textOnly>
