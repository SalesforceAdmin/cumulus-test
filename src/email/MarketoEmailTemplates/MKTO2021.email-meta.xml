Here are the steps: 1. Log in to the MBO account click on &quot;personal info&quot; and then click on &quot;home office certification.&quot; Once on that page, check the box that states &quot;I want to declare a home office&quot; and hit save. (This will allow us to deduct the mileage.) 2. Once you have certified that you have a home office you may go in and enter the expenses by following these instructions. &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf&gt; Details on our Dental insurance coverage can be found here. &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-exec-group-benefits-dental-plan-2012&gt; If you would like to walk through this together on the phone I am more than happy to do that as well. Thanks Anne,Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com If you are in the DC area please check out our upcoming networking event!  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: Things to Know about MBO Partners Sarah,I am concerned about the tolls to Ashburn, which amount to $4.40 per day, plus the 46 miles round-trip to the office at Intelligent Design.  I would like to be able to deduct them at the rate I use for government local travel at .$.51  per mile.  Is that possible.  I have used a whole tank of gas going back and forth with no other destinations in between.  Other than that I have just mild interest in the dental insurance.  Our health insurance is already taken care of.   If you could help me with the travel expenses that would help a lot.Best,  Anne ____________________________________________________________Woman is 53 But Looks 25Mom reveals 1 simple wrinkle trick that has angered doctors...http://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL3141/5051e17734a2b61777777st02duc &lt;http://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL3141/5051e17734a2b61777777st02duc&gt;</textOnly>
