Here is an example of some information that I would send to a client for one of my consultants when engaging them for a new project:
 
 
MBO Partners is a corporate platform for consultants who find their own work and engagements.  With over 20 years of experience administering professional contract workers, MBO understands the complexities of co-employment and 1099 risk.  We mitigate tax-related contractor risks by making it easy for independent consultants to take advantage of our W-2 employment program.  Through our program, they gain access to a high quality benefits package as well as a full suite of business processing services. We carry comprehensive business insurances, including General Liability, Errors and Omissions, and Workers’ Compensations policies that our Associates are covered under. If you would like a more in-depth view of our services, please visit www.mbopartners.com. 
 
Attached is the standard agreement we use when engaging our Associates with their clients.  Please review and complete it, and return a signed copy to me. And, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thanks again, and I look forward to working with you. 
 
Best regards,
 
I have also attached the “Intro for Hiring Managers” PDF that we discussed on the phone and a copy of the Master Service agreement that I would normally send to a new client (if they do not insist that we use theirs)
 
Please let me know if you have any questions about this.
 
Thanks!
Nicolette
