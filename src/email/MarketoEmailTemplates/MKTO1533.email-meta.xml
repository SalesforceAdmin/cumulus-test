    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We’re reaching out because we know you have had an interest in MBO Partners and the independent workforce sector in the past.

We wanted to share the news that MBO Partners just released a study  that you may be interested in. For the first time, there’s real hard  facts about The State of Independence in America (http://info.mbopartners.com/stateofindependence) that will reveal not just how many millions of independent  professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that  motivate them and help them stay happily independent.

That’s not all. We recently relaunched our Web site (http://www.mbopartners.com/) which includes relevant tools such as a Bill Rate Calculator (http://www.mbopartners.com/#billrate), a self-assessment tool on independence (http://www.mbopartners.com/#rightforyou), and a video that shows how we help independents succeed (http://www.mbopartners.com/#howwehelp) in today’s project economy. We encourage you to take a look.

To those in our company that have been following and serving the  independent consulting sector for more than two decades, it’s clear that  we’re entering a new age of independence. It’s no surprise to us that  MBO Partners has been in the news (http://www.mbopartners.com/news-events/news) recently. In fact, our CEO, Gene Zaino, has done a series of interviews  this summer and fall on the move to an independent workforce – including sharing tips on going independent in this ABC News segment (http://abcnews.go.com/Business/video/going-independent-13905900) – that you may enjoy viewing.

As always, we’re here to make it easier for independent consultants  to do business. If you would like to chat, you may book a time in my  online schedule by going here {{lead.EM TTLink:default=https://my.timedriver.com/C9CPC}}.

Regards,

{{lead.EM FName:default=Steve}}
