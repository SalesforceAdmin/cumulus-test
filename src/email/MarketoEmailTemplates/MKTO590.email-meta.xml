I had a nice holiday with my family I hope you did the same!
 
I am excited to hear you are moving forward with MBO, and I will send you the link to enroll in the system shortly.  You will follow the link, complete the online paperwork and at the end there will be an enrollment packet for you to print off, and in that packet is an I-9 form that you need to take to a local notary to have them sign as an authorized representative (there is also an example page of what they fill out and what you sign).  I will need you to email or fax the signed document to me and your piece of the enrollment will then be complete.  
 
I would be happy to have a follow up conversation with you and will attach the link to my calendar below for you to schedule a convenient time.

I look forward to speaking with you and have a Happy New Year!
 
Nicolette

Hi, Nicolette, hope you&apos;re having a pleasant holiday as well as some high quality time off.
 
I have a few consulting opportunities that may gel in January.  I&apos;d like to enroll with MBO so we can hit the ground running when the time comes. 
 
I&apos;d like to connect with you next week if possible. Please refresh me on getting into your appointment scheduling system. 
 
Thanks, and Happy New Year!
 
Mark
