We received your contact information from Carl Puckett, a current member of MBO Partners who believes you could greatly benefit from our program. My name is Sara Conde, a Consultant Services Advisor, and I invite you to learn what MBO Partners is all about &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program/why-mbo?r=Carl%20Puckett&amp;re=Dennis&gt;, and decide for yourself.
For more than 25 years, our company has led the independent consulting sector in America. Our mission is simple we make it easy for independent consultants and their clients to work together by handling the administrative, financial, legal, tax and expense burdens that bog down consultants, thus increasing their billable time. In addition, we provide them access to the largest exclusive online community of successful independent consultants, the clients that engage with them, and a multitude of valuable resources. Click here &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program/why-mbo?r=Carl%20Puckett&amp;re=Dennis&gt; to learn more about what MBO Partners can do for independent consultants.
Here are some recent tools we have developed to empower our consultants to thrive in their independent careers that you might find useful:

You may also wish to sign-up for our monthly Independent Consulting Brief &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/mpages/ch-2012-04-01/ic-newsletter.html?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=ICB%2B-%2BMZ%2BTwitter%2BPost&amp;utm_campaign=ICB%2B-%2BMZ%2BTwitter%2BPost&gt; to stay up to date on the many resources that we provide to the consulting marketplace.
