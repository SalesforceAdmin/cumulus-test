Thank you for this detail. If it makes you feel better I can’t quite get my head around how this would work with MBO either. J I am going to run this by our controller and I will let you know what I hear back.
 
Have a great weekend!
Sara

Sara,
 
Thanks for the response. 
 
With regard to an example, here is one. We are developing a planning spreadsheet tool that can be licensed to other consultants to use when conducting planning sessions with credit unions. We are thinking that we can either license it per engagement, in which case they would pay us a fee for each client engagement where they use our tool, or we can create a license that allows them to use the tool any time they want for a period of time. 
 
I am okay with either approach, but it seems that the per engagement approach would be easier to immediately run through the MBO process because we would simply bill the user when we &quot;sell&quot; them the tool&apos;s use.
 
Long term I think I would prefer to run both license options but I can&apos;t get my mind around how an annual license relationship would work through MBO.

Sara,
 
Thanks for the information. I will take a look this afternoon. It may answer a few lingering question I have. 
 
I think I am nearly to the point of making a decision, I just want to make sure I am more clear on how I would work with others under the agreement - whether as a subcontractor for someone else, or using others as subcontractors. In a purely legal since MBO would be the subcontractor to the client and you would be our employee for tax purposes.
 
We are also looking at licensing the use of some of our tools. I imagine that we would collect license fees from those types of partners as we would via other &quot;clients&quot; - through the MBO billing process. I need more detail on this before giving a complete answer. What tools would you be licensing, how much money would you plan on making from  these fees? Can you give me  a real life example? Is it per transaction or something along the lines of if x happens you pay us 10k? Just want to get a feel for this.

Steve,
 
Thanks for the invitation. I am currently considering MBO Partners, but I think one of the differences between our situation and the target audience is that we have been in business for 6 years. There is no question that we are ready to go solo.
 
Do you have any webinars tailored to existing companies/brands and their migration to the MBO infrastructure?
 
Tom
