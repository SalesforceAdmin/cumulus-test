Subject: Re: MBO Partners / James Willmarth Nicolette, Thank you for the follow up message.  Things are still in a holding pattern right now, and I just started a large project that will likely push my plans back for some time.  The information you provided was very helpful, and I will let you know if things change and I may need your help. All the best,James On Aug 5, 2012, at 3:08 PM, Nicolette Taylor &lt;ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:ntaylor@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:
Hello James,
I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?
Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
	- There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one:

	- MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, there’s real hard facts about The State of Independence in America &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPXByb2QtbC0yOTcmbWVzc2FnZWlkPTI5NyZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEzMzQ4ODkwMjkmc2VyaWFsPTEyNjQ4OTI2MDImZW1haWxpZD1qd2lsbG1hcnRoQGdsb2JhbC50LWJpcmQuZWR1JnVzZXJpZD1sLTEyOC0xMTc5Ny0xMjA2ODAyJmV4dHJhPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;http://info.mbopartners.com/stateofindependence?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvKjNZKXonjHpfsX56ewrUae0lMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ATsBrI%2FqLAzICFpZo2FFVGO8%3D&gt; that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent. 

Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.
