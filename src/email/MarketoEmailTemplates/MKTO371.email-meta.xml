Dear Elizabeth, 
 
Thank you for the inquiry you submitted at the MBO Partners website.  I wanted to introduce myself as the person at MBO Partners responsible for all new associate and partnership requests. I’ll be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services or answer any specific questions you may have.  I know you mentioned that you prefer to correspond by email but I would like to have a brief conversation with you to get a few more details about what you are looking for so I may be able to determine if MBO is a good fit for what your company is looking for.  You may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here: https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK
 
You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube: http://youtu.be/zKDzwSTmGv4. 
 
I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners!
 
Thank you and have a great day!
Nicolette
