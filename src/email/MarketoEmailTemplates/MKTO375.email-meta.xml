Enclosed are a few items we spoke about regarding MBO and our incorporation status- things that a lender or a client may want.  I was incorrect about NJ, I think they re-incorporated in VA once we moved down from NJ (we were first started back in 1986).  We recently re-branded for marketing purposes, our old name is ‘mybizoffice’, hence ‘MBO’. 
 
 
I’ve also enclosed our W9 and Wire and payment info. Still looking into the fee associated with international receipts.  I’ll let you know as soon as I know.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
