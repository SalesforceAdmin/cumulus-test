Steve,
 
Thanks for the update.  I have still not have time to complete the paperwork in my MBO box.  I promise I will get that done by EOD.

Pamela,
 
I spoke with David, we had a brief but nice conversation.  Everything is smooth sailing from a paperwork standpoint.  He is going to review and get back to me should there be a need for any edits. 
 
Regards,
 
Steve
