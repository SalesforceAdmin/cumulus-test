I asked around to see if MBO had anyone we could refer in terms of international licensing and secrecy agreements and unfortunately this just not something we familiarity with. 
I wish you the best of luck and please let me know if there is anything else we may be able to help you with. Thanks for connecting!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
