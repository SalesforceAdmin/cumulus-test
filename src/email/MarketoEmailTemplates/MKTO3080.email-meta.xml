Subject: Questions regarding potential international consultancy Good morning Kelly,  Happy New Year!  As an MBO associate (#18191), I have recently relocated to Dakar, Senegal for the next four years. More recently, I have spoken with the international NGO “Save the Children” about potential consultant work here in Dakar for 2014 and have a few questions about using MBO Partners as the PER/billing/invoicing vehicle.  Firstly, what experience, if any, does MBO have in working with Save the Children (whether Save the Children International (SCI), or any of its country affiliations)?  In particular, I would like to know what administrative activities or tasks might SCI have to arrange in order to work with MBO, in contrast to simply working through me directly. We have never worked with Save the Children previously but that doesn’t mean we wouldn’t be able to work with them for this engagement. All they would need to do is fill out a one page statement of work &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Independent_Consultant_Statement_of_Work.pdf&gt; for us so that we would have all the information needed to bill. They will likely send you an independent consulting agreement which we can review for you and give you tips on best practices before you sign. As a rule of thumb, its best not to sign anything until we review it for you. I will send you a template email that you could use to introduce us if and when that becomes appropriate. Once that is done the only difference to your client is that they would receive an invoice from MBO and pay MBO (instead of receiving an invoice from you and paying you).  Also, while I signed up with MBO some years ago, I have not yet had an opportunity to use MBO’s services. Are there any outstanding issues that I need to address or have there been any significant changes to how MBO works in the past couple years? Not too much has changed. Our fee would still be 5% on the first 125K in gross billings from your customer and 1.5% thereafter (within an anniversary year). I would want to run a new estimate for you so we could ensure the taxes are what you expect and recall from your time enrolling previously. In order to do that I would need the following information: ·         Brief description of work·         Rate for work (hourly, deliverable etc.)·         If hourly, how many hours a week·         Confirmation that you still filed Married, 0 (for your federal withholdings)·         What state (if any) you will be claiming (we have you set up for Texas now) You do have the option to put “foreign” as your “state” on a W-4 if you do not claim a US residence – but please confirm that with your accountant as I cannot provide any official tax advice Finally, although I have re-reviewed the information on your website, might you have any quick-start guides (e.g. descriptions of the steps involved in starting up a new consultant relationship and what to expect from MBO or the client) that could help me navigate this new process?  Yes, please refer to the introduction email I will send your way and check out my private landing page &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/advisor-info-s-conde.html&gt; which has detailed operational information.  Any other insights or suggestions would be warmly welcomed.  Many thanks in advance! Kindly, Kurt  - - - - -Kurt KrausseDakar, SenegalCell: +221 77 684 1481 </textOnly>
