    <subject>MBO Partners Independent Consulting Brief - June 2012</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
I’m pleased to share that the first social business platform created exclusively for independent consultants and their clients was launched this month. Called MBO Access, this Jive-software &lt;http://www.jivesoftware.com/&gt; powered community was created based on inputs from successful consultants and through insights from national data on independent work. The private platform helps independent consultants who use MBO as their business management vehicle to efficiently connect with like-minded professionals – as well as interact with member enterprise clients. Members also enjoy access to rich resources such as marketing and business development tools, professional development opportunities, and exclusive perks and discounts.

HOW TO LAND YOUR FIRST CLIENT 
AS AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT
When you begin a career as an independent consultant, one worry may dampen your excitement: landing your first client. Without any previous clients to vouch for your expertise, you may be nervous that clients will bypass you for a more experienced consultant. Although a referral from a previous employer helps, you still may wonder how to ease a potential client’s fears about working with someone who is a new entrant into the independent consulting world.

If this is one of your concerns, you should start planning your business strategies and marketing activities well before your launch. Below, we’ve listed three main points of focus around which to craft your plan:

1. Learn the fundamentals of consulting in your industry.

You may be good at what you do, but are you ‘plugged in’ to how independent consultants operate in your industry space? While you’re considering the transition, gain as much knowledge about your industry as you can. Check, and contribute to, online forums and professional sites like LinkedIn &lt;http://www.linkedin.com&gt;. These sites are excellent places to share your expertise and network. By exchanging knowledge, you can build credibility before you head out on your own. People will begin to regard you as a trusted source of information in your industry. The goal is to become the top-of-mind resource for projects in your field, and also learn from others that are offering services. Consider attending our Webinar on how to use LinkedIn &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/June12Web-LinkedIn-Independent-Consultants.html&gt; to build your client base as a solo business.

SUCCESS STORY

Steve Arhancet
 Director, Consultant Services,
 MBO Partners

Steve Arhancet, director of Consultant Services for MBO Partners, shares the story of a big contract win for an MBO Alumni Associate. It all started with a difficult game of chicken between the Associate and an over-reaching procurement office. 
 “We were able to provide some really useful guidance both to help win the contract – and also to significantly decrease the risks.”

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. How does MBO Partners fit in the picture with my new client?
A. It’s not a black and white answer – every client is different.  For example, if you contract with an enterprise (such as a larger Fortune 500 company) you simply introduce us to your point of contact at the client and we handle all the paperwork, contract negotiation and vendor set-up (even the business insurances that might be required).
If your client is a smaller firm, or someone you have a pre-existing relationship working with the contract or proposal, your statement of work process can be different.  Our job at MBO is to serve you – so we cater to the way you want to work with your client and provide the protection and ease of administration that you are looking for whatever your client scenario may be. It’s why we call our service ‘white glove’ and why we successfully retain so many independent consultants as long term associates.
