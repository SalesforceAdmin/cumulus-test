    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=future associate}},

I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?

Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:


 - There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one:

 - MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, thereâ€™s real hard facts about The State of Independence in America &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/index.html&gt; that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent.



I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
