Enclosed is the estimate to get to the Net80 that you are looking for. 
 
Your comment on the employer tax, it is currently not being waived, it has been reduced for social security.  This is reflected in the estimate enclosed.
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Steve,
 
Two points.
 
1) I am looking to get $80 per hour as a W2 (before my taxes). What extra amount on the hourly rate would I need to ask for, with Employer taxes etc and your overhead, to reach the net $80.
 
2) I believe the government is currently waiving the employer tax, how would that affect the rate
 
thanks,
 
John Westlake

Marcel,
 
I have a question.
 
I am looking at a contract with a company. My usual mode is to go thru a third party who pay me as a W2. The company I work for pay the third party, they pay the Employee tax and any other overheads. They take their 5%, and then I get the remainder. 
 
My questions are:
 
1) Do you act as the third party?. My previous relation with MBO was were you handled my details for the third party, this time I am trying work without the third party, with possibly MBO filling that role.
 
Yes, we can act as a third party.  The client would pay c2c to MBO Partners, we would then pay you on a W2.  

 
2) If you do act as the third party, what rate do you take for your services?
 
We charge 5% of the rate that is paid to MBO.  We pull this off pre-tax for you and only charge it when the money comes in from the client.  There are no obligations, commitments – we are simply paid when you are paid.

 
I am trying to calculate how much overhead I need to add to the rate I negoitiate with the client to cover your costs, while still paying me my hourly rate.
 
We can do what is called a net cash estimate or financial illustration showing you what the bill rate to the client would look like being run through MBO with all the deductions/taxes, etc coming out and the net amount.  I can run one of these with you over the phone.  Just give me a call or schedule time in my online schedule by going here: https://my.timedriver.com/C9CPC.


Hope this makes sense
 
yours,
 
John Westlake

Dear John,
  
My name is Marcelle Saab, MBO Partners’ new program manager responsible for interaction with our Associates and Alumni. I’m happy to share with you that MBO Partners is launching a refreshed brand to the marketplace.
  
MBO Partners has been growing quickly. As businesses migrate to the new Project Economy with more and more work being procured on a contract basis, we have emerged as a leader in helping independent workers and their clients work together. As a result, we’re compelled to enhance our messaging and demonstrate how MBO Partners is central to this growing trend.
  
Last month, MBO Partners launched a new look and feel throughout our organization, including a new Web site (www.mbopartners.com) and refreshed branding. Last week we also launched a new-and-improved user interface for the online Business Center that’s central to our Associate and client relationships.
  
We hope you take a moment to explore the new site.
  
As a result of these exciting changes, we’ve also been in the news recently. Here’s a few stories and links you may enjoy:
