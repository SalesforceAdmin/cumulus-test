I want to introduce you to Sara Conde.  I am going to be out of the office the next few days and then going on another business trip and I won’t be able to provide you the service levels you should be getting from MBO.  Sara is by far one of the best Consultant Services Advisors we have, you’re in great hands.  I’ve gotten her up to speed and she looks forward to working with you and will be in touch soon.
 
Steve

Dear Val and Patrick,
The reason why I requested an electronic version of the contract to review was because I wanted to review it and introduce you to Steve Arhancet at MBO Partners.  MBO Partners handles tax, expense, benefit, payment and contract management for independent consultants.  Steve is my contact at MBO Partners that manages my various contracts.  I wanted to send a brief introduction as a couple changes in the contract will be needed.  His information is below and will be following up shortly.  If interested more information can be found at www.mbopartners.com 

Thanks,
Jake
