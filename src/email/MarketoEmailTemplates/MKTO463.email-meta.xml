Dear Metasebia,

Were reaching out because we know you have had an interest in MBO Partners and the independent workforce sector in the past.

We wanted to share the news that MBO Partners just released a study that you may be interested in. For the first time, theres real hard facts about The State of Independence in America that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent.

Thats not all. We recently re-launched our Web site which includes relevant tools such as a Bill Rate Calculator, a self-assessment tool on independence, and a video that shows how we help independents succeed in todays project economy. We encourage you to take a look.

To those in our company that have been following and serving the independent consulting sector for more than two decades, its clear that were entering a new age of independence. Its no surprise to us that MBO Partners has been in the news recently. In fact, our CEO, Gene Zaino, has done a series of interviews this summer and fall on the move to an independent workforce  including sharing tips on going independent in this ABC News segment  that you may enjoy viewing.

As always, were here to make it easier for independent consultants to do business. How can I help you? Just hit reply and let me know, so I can be in touch.
