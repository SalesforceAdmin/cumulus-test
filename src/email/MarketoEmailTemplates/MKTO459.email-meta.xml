Unemployed since late August. Still in job searching.

We recently launched a new consultant-focused Web site   which includes relevant tools such as a Bill Rate Calculator  , a self-assessment tool on independence  , and a video that shows how we help independents succeed   in today&apos;s project economy. We encourage you to take a look.  Whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America    . I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation  . Please feel free to reply to this email and provide an update on how your contract search is going. Are you working on a project now or you currently working W2 at the moment?
