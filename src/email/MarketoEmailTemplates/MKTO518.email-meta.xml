That email was an auto generated email that goes out automatically when someone places an inquiry in our system.  I actually sent you an email with additional information on Tuesday per your request.  Please let me know if you did not receive the email and I will resend it to you.
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Nicolette,
 
Thank you for your e-mail, but it is apparent you did not read or simply chose not to honor the request for information I submitted via the MBO Partners website. I am not interested in speaking with an &quot;Enrollment Manager&quot; or a salesperson by any title until I better understand specifically what services you offer and on what basis you charge for them. Once I have more information and have had a chance to evaluate it, I will call you for an appointment -- or not -- depending on whether I am interested in potentially becoming a client.
 
Thank you.
 
Matt Podowitz
