    <textOnly>Does filing taxes and submitting expenses for your solo business stress you out?
When you work with MBO Partners, we take on the burden of tax witholding and expense filing, saving you time and gray hairs. This significantly reduces your risk of audit, so you don&apos;t waste billable hours worrying about exposure to the IRS.

MBO provides an easy-to-use online system to submit your expenses, including medical and dependent care. So, don&apos;t until April for your refund; with MBO, your expense write-offs are processed with each paycheck.
