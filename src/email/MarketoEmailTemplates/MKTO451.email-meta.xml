    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

I wanted to share the news that MBO Partners just released a study   that you may be interested in. For the first time, there’s real hard   facts about The State of Independence in America (http://info.mbopartners.com/the-state-of-independence.html) that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent.

That’s not all. We recently re-launched our Web site (www.mbopartners.com) which includes relevant tools such as a Bill Rate Calculator (http://www.mbopartners.com/#billrate), a self-assessment tool on independence (http://www.mbopartners.com/#rightforyou), and a video that shows how we help independents succeed (http://www.mbopartners.com/#howwehelp) in today’s project economy. We encourage you to take a look.

Take a moment to instantly schedule an appointment (https://my.timedriver.com/C9CP) if you’d like to take advantage of my time and interest in the independent professional’s unique challenges and needs.

Are you currently working in a W2 role and thinking of starting your   first contract? Are you already working independently and have a new  project commencing? Now is a great time to connect with MBO Partners.

As always, we’re here to make it easier for independent consultants to do business.
