I wanted to touch base as a courtesy and see how the contract search is going.

We have a number of consultant resources that we continually update that you may find helpful.   You may find them here: http://www.mbopartners.com/resources.  In addition, if you have any suggestions for new resources that might help other consultants - please let us know!

Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Nicolette
