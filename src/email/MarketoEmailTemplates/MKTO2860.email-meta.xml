    <textOnly>{{lead.First Name:default=Consultant}},

There are more self-employed professionals starting out in America every day - and working in teams can give those independents a competitive edge. MBO&apos;s Team Center is a way for consultants to use state of the art technology to organize they way they manage a team of independent workers.

If you work with a team of consultants, check out this story &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/CSA-Story-October_2013.pdf&gt; about three MBO Associates who use the Team Center to manage a successful business.
