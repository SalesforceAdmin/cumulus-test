I will keep trying, I agree it would be best if we can get this closed out before the holiday. I will keep you posted with any updates.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: Trueffect - Len O&apos;Toole - MBO Partners Agreement Hi Sara,  I was wondering if we have had any movement on the Agreement with Trueffect? I pinged my hiring manager at Trueffect yesterday and he said he was going to push on a few people. It might not hurt to ping Gina for a status. The double pressure might get it kick started ...  I would love to have this all sorted out this week before everyone goes on vacation... Trueffect will be closed all next week... Thanks Sara - Len OToole Sent from Windows Mail From: Sara Conde

Importance: High Dear Gina ,  My name is Sara and I am a Consultant Services Advisor at MBO Partners. Your name was forwarded to me by Len OToole. On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with your firm. MBO Partners caters to two markets.  Our first service is designed for independent consultants and  small businsses &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/#howwehelp&gt; who choose to plug into our MBO Services Cloud to make it easier for them to work with their clients.  We take care of all the back office administrative, HR, regulatory and financial issues so they can stay focused on delivering on their services.  The second is how we help enterprise organizations engage more efficiently and safely with their contract workforce &lt;http://www.mboenterprise.com/how-we-help&gt;.  We have also put together a short one page collateral &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Introduction.pdf&gt; that explains how we work and the markets we serve. The following links provide our standard agreement &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_MSA_Template.pdf&gt; and statement of work &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_SOW.pdf&gt;  we use when engaging our Associates with their clients.  Please review and complete it, and return a signed copy to me.
