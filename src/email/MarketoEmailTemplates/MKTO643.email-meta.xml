Dear James, 
 
Some time ago you requested information regarding the services offered by MBO Partners.  Now might not be the right time for you.  Whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.
 
Are you working on a contract/project now or are you currently working W2 at the moment?
 
Regards,
 
Nicolette
