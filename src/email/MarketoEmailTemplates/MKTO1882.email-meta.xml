He suggested this would be faster (since you are in a hurry to get the money over) and easier for your client.  If this is ok, you could send them our wire and payment information attached and also sign and return this acknoledgement form &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Contract_Acknowledgement_Form.pdf&gt;, we’ll keep this for our records.  Best regards, Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
