Subject: Re: Billing Rate for Mark Clark Thanks Sara. These worked great.  No further figures needed right now.  

One unrelated question:  email address.  Booz asked me if I had an MBO email address rather than my gmail.  They suggested I would get one from MBO.  Can you tell me if that is correct or not?  Makes a difference for business cards.

Thanks!  Have a good start to the week.  MarkOn Fri, Jul 13, 2012 at 4:25 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Hi Mark, It was nice talking with you today. I have attached two additional estimates for you. Please let me know if you would like to see any other figures. This estimates assume you have the 6% fee for security clearance just FYI.  Have a lovely weekend,Sara  From: Mark Clark [mailto:clarkmark7@gmail.com &lt;mailto:clarkmark7@gmail.com&gt;]

Subject: Billing Rate for Mark Clark Sara:

When you get a chance, could you run a bill rate calculation model for $175 and $200 per hour for me.  You walked me through an example with $150 per hour so I have that.  

At the time we did that example, however, I had not determined the exact 401K withdrawal percentage so I think you now have the data to do that for all three rates.  

Thanks for your help.  Available via phone if it is easier doing it that way.

Best regards, Mark </textOnly>
