This happened because you are in CA and we have had some issues with the notaries there. We are asking them to act as the authorized representative as they are a person of trust. They do not actually need to notarize the form and that is where confusion can come  (especially in  California.)  Anyhow it is no use trying to explain this if they don&apos;t want to sign the form.  I  just spoke with a notary named John Minjiras he said he would be happy to sign the form for you. He works out of San Francisco and he asked for you to give him a call so he could set up a time to meet with you. His number is 415-290-7160 and his email is notaryjohn@yahoo.com &lt;mailto:notaryjohn@yahoo.com&gt;. He said phone is the best way to get him quickly.  He is expecting your call.  Thanks again Mike and sorry for the trouble.
Take care,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: MBO Enrollment The notary refuses to sign the I9, and gave me an article for notaries on why they cannot do that. I don&apos;t know what to do. Mike On 05/30/2012 11:53 AM, Sara Conde wrote:&gt; &gt; Hi Mike,&gt; &gt; Congrats onyour project with Cisco!I sent you the link to enroll in &gt; our system in a sepreate email.
