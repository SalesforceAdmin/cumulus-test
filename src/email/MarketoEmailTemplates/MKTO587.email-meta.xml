Thanks for the reply!  That’s pretty amazing you do that; I’ll definitely keep you on the list for notifications of our future webinars. 
 
Have a great new year as well.

Greetings and Good Day Mr. Arhanacet:
     It is unfortunate but I cannot attend your webinar tomorrow due to a prior committment with the Red Cross.  I am a regular Apheresis donor and they need me badly.  I give 3 donations of life saving platelettes each time I go every two weeks.  It just so happens tomorrow is my day again.  
     I would appreciate being notified of the next webinar and pehaps it won&apos;t be on a Friday the next time.  I would have attended if there was not a conflict to seek information.
     A Joyous and Happy New Year to you and your family.
 
Sincerely,
 
Arthur J Plourde

 &quot;Freedom is never more than a generation away from extinction.  We didn&apos;t pass it to our children through our blood stream.  It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children&apos;s children what it was once like in the United States when men were free.&quot;   
(President Ronald Reagan)
 
May God bless and keep all of our Armed Forces personnel in his care.  May he preserve and protect those who are comitted through their bravery, and courage to defend this nation, it&apos;s values, principles, freedom, liberty and it&apos;s people.

Dear Arthur J.,
Along the way, you shared with us that you have considered independent consulting as a career path. We appreciate your interest in our company and the topic of independence. It&apos;s a subject we are passionate about.
Each year, we observe a surge in interest around the topic just after the holidays from connections new and old. You may be interested in participating in our pre-New-Years Webinar:
Title: Is Independent Consulting Right For You?
Date/Time: Tomorrow, 12/30, at 12:30 PM EST
Or just reading about our point of view in a recent posting we did.
Steve
