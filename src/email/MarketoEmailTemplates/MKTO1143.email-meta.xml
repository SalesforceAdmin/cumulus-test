Date: Tuesday, February 21, 2012, 11:27 AMHi Anthony, I work as a Consultant Services Advisor at MBO now. My primary role is speaking with people who are interested in using MBO and helping them determine if it is the right fit. I act as a business manager for them for their first two payrolls and then hand them off to a long term business manager once they are comfortable with the process. So the short answer is yes, I still work as a business manager for consultants that I bring on. Is there something you needed help with? Thanks,
