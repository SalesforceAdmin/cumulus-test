I made a few suggested changes based on my experience; it’s up to you if you choose to implement them. If you have any questions about my suggested changes let me know. When appropriate, please edit the email below and send to your client contact, making sure to CC me on the email as well. This information will introduce MBO Partners, provide our payment information and other documents, and instruct them to complete the “Independent Consultant Statement of Work” so that we capture your relevant project information. Please let me know if you have any questions.

I appreciate your asking them on our behalf. I am familiar with and understand the benefits of working through an umbrella organization. Would you want to be put me in contract with MBO Partners to understand their method of payment (check, wire transfer, etc.), and other mechanical procedures?  I want to be prepared to follow your wishes. It sounds as though your wishes is to receive payment through them.  The procedure you&apos;d like to follow may start with getting me introduced as payor. Then I can comply with the payment method they prefer. I want to be prepared to act promptly. Best,Michael  Michael D.

I know 2 guys right away that DO pen testing and development right now..  they are good and I  like them
Both have their own LLC.. and do independent contracts already. .. 
one is with &quot;MBO Partners&quot; as I am, they do all the taxes, withholds,  etc.. act as our parent company. .. and they only charge 5% overhead... no other fees, plus it comes with professional liability insurance,  etc.. great package.
That&apos;s who I want to work with on our transactions too
So provide the high level scope. .. I will engage David Dodds and Glenn Jacobs and see if they are interested
