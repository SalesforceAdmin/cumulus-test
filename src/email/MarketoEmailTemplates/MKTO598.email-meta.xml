    <subject>RE: Fr Keith Chirico Re: LLC &amp; Proposal Assistance (1325618865.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>Keith, Congrats on the first proposal.  I would suggest we talk more about our services.  We are by far a superior alternative to setting up an LLC (if you are just doing professional consulting to business clients).  Were much easier to set-up and you retain all the same tax benefits of having an LLC.  You can easily book a time that works for you using my online schedule by going here.  https://my.timedriver.com/C9CPC Steve ___________________________________ Steve Arhancet Director, Consultant Services MBO Partners t: 703.793.6011 f: 703.793.6081 m: 540.560.8837 e: sarhancet@mbopartners.com w: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Working full time and departing OCONUS in a few weeks has been keeping me busy, however, I don&apos;t want to miss this first opportunity. Does MBO have any info or resource that outlines the &quot;how to&quot; LLC in VA? Provide assistance in establishing an LLC?  Assistance with proposals? What would be the fee for these services? Thanks in advance! Regards, Keith 252.876.1072 On 12/30/11, Steve Arhancet  wrote: &gt; Will do.
