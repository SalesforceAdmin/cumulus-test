    <subject>MBO Partners Independent Consulting Brief - October 2013</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
What consultant hasn’t thought – and worried – about developing the right Statement of Work or Scope of Work document (SOW)? Understanding what an SOW is, as well as understanding client&apos;s expectations, can be confusing without proper guidance.
 
That&apos;s why I am excited to moderate Thursday&apos;s SOW webinar &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/31OctWebSOW_RegistrationPage.html&gt;, where we will go over a step-by-step process consultants can use to create an effective and professional SOW. Register &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/31OctWebSOW_RegistrationPage.html&gt; to join us on this important topic, and connect with me &lt;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dave-putt/0/57a/a0&gt; on LinkedIn to get involved in the independent movement in America. Registrants will be also the first to receive our new SOW guide, which we will launch later this month.

CREATING AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTING SCOPE OF WORK DOCUMENT: TIPS AND A TEMPLATE
The scope of work (SOW) is a formal document that captures and defines the tasks, activities, deliverables and timeline an independent consultant will execute for a client project. It is an important tool for independent consultants because the scope determines the boundaries of the client project and can provide the foundation for measuring performance against project goals &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/how-will-you-measure-success&gt;.

Your scope of work becomes part of your contractual obligation &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/why-right-contract-matters&gt; to your client, so it is important to clearly delineate the entire scope without being too restrictive. The SOW will also help the client plan internal resources to accommodate the project. The SOW should address the following:


 - Work that will be performed
 - Roles and responsibilities
 - Timeline for work
 - Performance measurement
 - Payment terms



The scope of work may also define how the job is to be accomplished. It is important to clearly define the deliverables and objectives. Ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings and affect the success of your project.

This month, we feature Consultant Services Advisor Nicolette Taylor, who shares the story of one recent conversation that illustrates a new rung on the corporate ladder: independence as a lifestyle choice for senior executives.  

“I really enjoy talking with experienced independent professionals as well as recent “converts” because I always learn something from each story. It’s motivating that I can help people make this kind of change – they can use MBO to set up a new, rewarding work path and lifestyle.”

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. How do I manage my expenses with MBO Partners?

A. MBO will keep track of expenses and provide you with a tax benefit for each qualified expense you would otherwise have to itemize at the end of the year. This eliminates the need to keep that “shoe box” of receipts all year long.

We do this by making it easy, efficient, and convenient for you to submit an expense to us through our online system. Additionally, any time you put an expense through MBO and it’s approved, it becomes a tax compliant, fully documented expense deduction. This makes your return simpler and less likely to be audited.
