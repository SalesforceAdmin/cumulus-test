So nice speaking with you today. In order to run the numbers I need to know your county of residence for the MD tax form. Once I have that I will send you a net cash estimate that we can review via phone and explore which option will be the most adventatgous for you. 
 
Best regards,
Sara

Below is a sample email that I receive on a daily basis. In this case, which would be a better deal for me if I employed your services as a C2C?

I would like to know the rate on W-2/C2C before I continue to see if it falls within my parameters.
