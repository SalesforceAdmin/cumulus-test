I look forward to speaking with you as well!  I have included a link below to my calendar for you to schedule a convenient time for us to speak that works for you.  I also received an email from Carolyn giving me a bit of information about what she would like to accomplish with you working through MBO and would like to speak with you both about this to get more information on what you are looking for.
