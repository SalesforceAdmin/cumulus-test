	- Here are some time and expense entry instructions &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf&gt; for using our system.	- Here is a copy of our expense policy &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Expense_Policy.pdf&gt;.	- Here is a list of the most common expenses &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Expense_List.pdf&gt; you can submit to MBO.
 The next step is to schedule another time &lt;https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK&gt; that works for you so we can do a walk-through of the business center and I can show you all the great features. I look forward to working with you! Thank you,Nicolette___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;bbentley@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
