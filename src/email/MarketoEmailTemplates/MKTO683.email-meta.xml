My name is Sara Conde and I will be your contact at MBO Partners. I gave you a ring at the number listed below, but did not receive a prompt to leave a voicemail so I wanted to follow up via email.  I appreciate you sending your resume in however, MBO does not do any placements.  That being said, Ive enclosed a few resources that you might find helpful in finding your next project.  
 
 We have created an index of past webinars on topics specifically catered for independent consultants.  You can view our index by going here.   
 In addition we have a 2012 Webinar track that will cover everything to do with working independently.  We have three tracks, you can sign up to receive notifications when new webinars are scheduled by going here. 
If you have questions, feel free to schedule a convenient time for you using my online schedule.
 
Best of luck finding your next contract,
 
Sara

Dear Joe,
Its been some time since we last spoke, but I appreciate your interest in working with MBO Partners, and wanted to check in and share some news with you.
We recently launched a new Web site with a set of powerful tools built-in to help those assessing and getting ready for independent work to find their right fit. 
I wanted to share these tools with you personally, and encourage you to take a quick look.
Perhaps you are happily independent now, and have found a solution to manage your business life -- or you may have returned to working full time, or perhaps be in the midst of a search.
Whatever your work life stage, I hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independence in America has arrived, with a  workforce 16 million strong, and predicted to grow to more than 20 million by 2013. Our company well into a year-long journey to better understand and celebrate independent work in our nation, called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view the site&apos;s very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.
I do hope you will take time to learn if MBO Partners is right for you or not. Please stay in touch and let me know how I can help further your career. Parting thought: do you already know that number-one challenge or opportunity I can help you with?
Steve Arhancet
