I enter the data in our system and then it generates a PDF. I unfortunately do not have an excel version of the document. Please let me know if you have any other scenarios you would like for me to run. Thanks,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
