You are so welcome. Thank you for sending me these outreach collaterals. I think they are both clear, effective, and to the point but the one that drew my attention was the first attachment entitled “RKA – DC Recycling...”  It comes off a bit more personal and there is a subtle “call to action” by giving them information on your brand/company. Thank you so much for pointing out these typos – I use this email a lot and no one ever told me! J
 
Have a wonderful evening!

Sara,
 
Good afternoon.
Thank you for jumping in here, I appreciate it.  
As I understand it, I just need to agree on the dates in April with Eugenia at this point in time. 
 
I did some outreach yesterday afternoon since I feel like I&apos;m doing a lot to build my hotrod, but not nearly enough to secure races for it.
I sent out the later version of the attached item.  Let me know if you think it needs more ... something.   The earlier version -- also attached --  was sent to a couple of large business associations and -- I regret -- was less polished and perhaps too critical of the current regulatory environment and the typical way businesses fail-in-earnest to meet the District&apos;s strict requirements.  
 
This time, at the risk of sounding less urgent, I decided to stay positive.  I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a balance to strike, but I don&apos;t know where that is just yet.  Will you let me know, between the two, what you like?  The dates are marked on each file.
 
Thank you for staying involved and on top of everything!
 
Best,
Russell
 
ps.  
Forgive the observation: note typos in &quot;speaking&quot; and &quot;regulatory,&quot; below.

Dear Eugenia , 
 
It was so nice speakign with you this morning. On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with your firm.
 
MBO Partners caters to two markets.  Our first service is designed for independent consultants and  small businsses who choose to plug into our MBO Services Cloud to make it easier for them to work with their clients.  We take care of all the back office administrative, HR, regulartory and financial issues so they can stay focused on delivering on their services.  The second is how we help enterprise organizations engage more efficently and safely with their contract workforce.  We have also put together a short one page collateral that explains how we work and the markets we serve.
 
As we discussed, please send over your standard agreement for our review. And, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thanks again, and I look forward to working with you.  
 
Best regards,
 
Sara

Russell – Thanks for the quick response!  Can you provide a new proposal for Option B that includes 4 buildings.   I’m also hoping we will get a discount for adding one more building to the list? J
 
3 DC buildings include:
1707 L Street
1828 L Street
1909 K Street
 
1 MD building includes:
1101 Wootton Parkway, Rockville, MD.
 
I’ll talk to PM about exact dates for each building too, they will all be on different dates since they will each be over lunch time and most likely the week of Earth day or a week before it.  
 
Thanks!
