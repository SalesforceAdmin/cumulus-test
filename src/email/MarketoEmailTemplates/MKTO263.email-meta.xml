My name is Nicolette and I am an Enrollment Specialist with MBO.  Brendan Dillon forwarded me your information because he let us know that you are not going to be able to work with Booz Allen on the project you had initially reached out about, but you may be interested in working with MBO on other projects in the future outside of Booz.  I would be happy to speak with you if you are interested in MBO and have attached a link to my calendar below for you to select a convenient time for us to speak.

I look forward to speaking with you!
 
Nicolette
