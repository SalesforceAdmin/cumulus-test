    <textOnly>{{lead.First Name:default=Client}},

You may already know MBO as a trusted business management solution for independent consultants - but did you know that we can also make engaging ICs easier for you?

MBO introduces IC Engage &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/icengage/ntaylor&gt; â€“ in a nutshell, you refer your independent contractors to us, and we take care of the rest.

With IC Engage, your business can safely and efficiently bring on your independent workforce - even your high-billing, high-profile consultants. This program eliminates reclassification risk entirely while reducing co-employment threats - and it can be up-and-running in as little as one week.

To learn more about how you can get started, email me at ntaylor@mbopartners.com or call me today at 703.793.6281.

Best regards,

Nicolette Taylor
