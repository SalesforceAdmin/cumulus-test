Login to https://app1.mbopartners.com, using the username/password created by you.
 
Expenses:
Click on “expenses” located at the top of the screenClick on “add a new expense”Select the appropriate expense type from the list on the rightEnter in the required details (all fields marked with an asterisk)Upload receipt if necessary Click “save”; if the expense appears in Green you’re all set, if it appears in Orange you need to upload a receipt and if it appears in Black then you are missing information and you need to re-checkIf you prefer not to upload your receipt click on the tab labeled “Expense Report.”  This will create a cover sheet for your expenses 
Along with the cover sheet please fax (703-793-6070) or email (doc@mbopartners.com) all receipts to MBO. If you email please copy me as

Hi Steve,
 
Sorry for the delay . . . things have just been crazy between travel, work and having my 6-year old grandson for the summer (not much gets done when he’s around J).  I have FINALLY gone in and set up my account and now need to do the expense portion.  Can the money just sit in my business center until I am ready to invoice?  How does that work?
 
Maybe we can touch base on Monday to discuss.
 
Thanks for your patience!
 
Tricia

Tricia,
 
Unexpectedly, we received payment for you today for the work you did with EMP.  We however cannot pay you until you enroll in our system.  We will unfortunately have to send this money back to Atrium and wait for you to enroll, at which time we will request for them to repay the invoice we send.  
 
Can you please let me know when you plan to finish your enrollment?  If we can finish your enrollment today or Monday at the latest, we can have this deposited in your business center, but any longer and it will need to be sent back. 
 
I will call you as well.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
