I wanted to follow up on the remaining items needed to re-activate your account: o    I have attached an updated Net Cash Estimate based on current information in your account settings. Please review and let me know if you have any questions. I am also more than happy to review it with you via phone. This estimate assumes:§  40 hrs a week at $110 per hour§  $500 a month in non-billable operating expenses (this is just a conservative average of the amount of expenses we typically see to show you how the affect your take home pay)§  Single Medical and Dental Coverage§  Retirement at 20.04%§  Life insurance and Long term disability insurance – Please note you have to be working at least 25 hours a week to be eligible to make a claim against the policy per Aetna guidelines. I don’t think this should be an issue since you are working full time but I wanted to make sure you were aware.  o    Please provide the address where you will be preforming the work o    Please complete your MBO access profile by logging into MBO Access &lt;https://access.mbopartners.com/&gt; and completing the “Industry Expertise” and “Disciplines” sections of your profile. This information needed for our workmen’s comp. policy and must be completed before I can activate your account and get you billing.  Your user ID and password is the same as your MBO Business Center. Please let me know if you have any questions.
