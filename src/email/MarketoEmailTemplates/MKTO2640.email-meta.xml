Subject: MBO support for Latticeworks - follow-up Hi Sara,  I hope this finds you well.  I wanted to follow-up on our earlier discussions about working together to have you provide short-term benefits and back end services while Latticeworks scales up. While we still are not incorporated, Sallie (my co-founder) has just purchased a company which we can contract to and be paid through. I&apos;d therefore like to re-initiate discussion! In addition to myself, I am now working with Michelle (included on this email) who I would also like to ensure has benefits and MBO services. Could we perhaps set up another call this week to discuss how we would begin working together?  Finally, as I have been exploring the possibility of offering MBO services to the independent workers who would source work through Latticeworks  a number of questions that have come up for me around both MBO&apos;s practices and the way that it might interact with the contracting model we are considering. These questions include: 

- How does MBO handle the issue of payroll tax (do you pay it? Do the companies employing contractors pay it?)

- Will it be a tax issue if we have people working in a single role over a relatively lengthy period (eg 6-12 months)? Does this fundamentally contradict the IRS definition of contractual work? 

- What if we place people in &apos;key function&apos; roles over a limited period of time?

- Is it true that working more than 20 hours a week for 6 consecutive months for the same company triggers &apos;employment&apos; as defined by the IRS? These questions could be resolved during our phone discussion or by email.  I look forward to being back in touch. All the best,Clelia </textOnly>
