Subject: Re: Important Info Re. Projects with Insight Hi Nicole,It is great to hear from you. I will work on the survey later and setup a time with you, but I need to clarify something. This is not an assignment through Insight Enterprises and they know nothing about this. I do not work for them directly, but I have worked for them as a contractor for the past 2 years.  I am on a break from Insight (going to school and recovering from recent foot surgery).  I provided the Insight information as background but my intention was to work directly through MBO and not have Insight involved in this engagement because Insight charges more than Ed / CNA would pay for my services.  I have a long school day today but will get back to setting up a time to chat later. Thank You! Kind Regards, Meg PlummerOn Thu, Jan 17, 2013 at 8:10 AM, Nicole Brotherton &lt;nbrotherton@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:nbrotherton@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Hi Meg, My name is Nicole Brotherton, and Ed forwarded me your name and email address so I can help get you on boarded for any future assignments with Insight. My company, MBO Partners, helps Insight manage its engagement of contract-based workers and small businesses. As you work on your assignment with Insight, you’ll be working “through” MBO.  We’ll handle your invoicing, payments, and more so you can stay focused on your work. I’m sure you’re eager to get started on your assignment, but there are some steps to take care of first. Schedule a time to speak with me. 
I’ll conduct a personal consultation with you to learn about your business and work with Insight.  Based on this understanding, we’ll discuss the best MBO engagement service for your situation. To schedule a time that works best for you, use this link (or paste into your browser’s location bar): https://www.timetrade.com/book/V5F96 &lt;https://www.timetrade.com/book/V5F96&gt;.  Complete the “MBO Partners Introductory Survey.” 
Before we speak, follow this link (or paste into your browser’s location bar): https://mbopartners.us2.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_9sHq2zZv0uJ0Boh &lt;https://mbopartners.us2.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_9sHq2zZv0uJ0Boh&gt;. This survey helps MBO understand how you operate your consulting business and enables us to focus our call the information that will be most important to you. The survey should take less than 10 minutes. Please note that if you do not complete the survey before we speak, I will complete it for you during the consultation call. However, the call will go much faster if you take the survey first.  During the consultation, we’ll also go over how to enroll with MBO to be ready for any assignments. Thanks and I look forward to speaking with you! Best Regards,Nicole ___________________________________Nicole BrothertonAccount Manager, Enterprise SolutionsMBO Partners t: 703.793.6034 &lt;tel:703.793.6034&gt;f: 703.793.6083 &lt;tel:703.793.6083&gt;e: nbrotherton@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:nbrotherton@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
