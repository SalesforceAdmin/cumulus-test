You are very welcome!
 
When working through us, you can only be a part of our benefits plan if you are actively billing.  If for some reason a project ends and you know there wont be work for more than a month we would have to cancel your benefits and at that time you would be eligible to go on Cobra (and the premium would be only about 2% more than the regular premium).  We cannot allow people to send us payment for the benefits because it is an employer sponsored plan and if someone isnt working they cannot be a part of the medical benefits.  Usually if there is a long amount of time between projects we would place your account in alumni status effectively closing the account for accounting purposes but you can easily re-enroll if you get another project and at the time you are re-activated you would be eligible to join the benefits plan again.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette,
 
Thanks for the information. I scanned through it and plan to carefully review it over the weekend. 
 
Can you please clarify how benefits coverage would be handled when I am not working? To maintain coverage, would I continue to pay the same monthly benefits costs as when I am working on a client project?  
 
Vernice Davis
