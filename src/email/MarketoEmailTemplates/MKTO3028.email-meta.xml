I wanted to follow up on our conversation and give you a starting point template email to send to folks that will help describe the MBO Exec model as we discussed. Please feel free to edit this in any way you see fit and let me know if you need any other information.   Hi X, It was nice speaking with you today and I look forward to a potential future partnership. As we discussed, Quant 6 has a partnership in place with MBO Partners and we would use them as the engagement vehicle for payment on any services run through our firm.  MBO Partners’ provides liability insurance and back office administration services to independent consultants by allowing IC’s to run their business (and even payroll themselves) under MBO’s corporate tax ID. You can  watch a short video about who they are on You Tube &lt;http://youtu.be/zKDzwSTmGv4&gt;. You can learn more about how MBO works by clicking here &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/how-mbo-works&gt;. Quant 6 will cover for the MBO service fee.  If and when appropriate I will connect you with one of their Client Services Advisors who will give you a consultation call to walk through the program and provide you with a detailed financial estimate so you know exactly what to expect.  Best,Mike   ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!
