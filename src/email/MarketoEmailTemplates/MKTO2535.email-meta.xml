    <subject>Biotech companies best practices for 1099s (1365186861.0)</subject>
    <textOnly>Steve,  The reason for reaching out to you is to provide you with insight into the best practices that biotech companies are leveraging to engage with independent contractors. I am also writing Lynn Cavalier and Bob Reffner at Firstenergy to provide this information. Below you can read a brief case study that illustrates how these best practices go beyond just mitigating 1099 risk to actually benefiting your bottom line.    ·         The Business Need ·         Biotech company engaged with expert contract workers and former employees as 1099s to assist with important projects. ·         Many independent professionals are high-end contract workers such as scientists, clinical researchers, analysts, developers, marketing specialists, etc. ·         The Big Problem ·         Got audited by the state of Massachusetts for 1099s.  ·         General Counsel realized that eliminating 1099s going forward would cause too much business disruption and a loss of needed external expertise. ·         High-end professional contract workers did not want to work for a staffing or payrolling company. ·         The Solution ·         General Council learned from a peer that MBO Partners specializes in IC engagements and has a solution specifically built to support how higher-end ICs prefer to work.  ·         After due diligence, selected MBO as their IC engagement specialist. ·         The Result ·         Professional contract workers willingly engage through one of MBO’s tax-compliant solutions. ·         MBO indemnifies for tax risk so that it is fully mitigated.  ·         The Icing on the Cake ·         Established a virtual bench of just-in-time, compliant contractors for important projects. ·         Enhanced their visibility into spend. ·         Reduced their administrative burden. ·         Mitigated their workers’ comp and related risks by ensuring ICs have proper business insurance. ·         Don’t have to pay exorbitant staffing/payrolling fees.   MBO currently helps Biogen Idec, Pfizer and Merck. What I am proposing to you today is to schedule a time to talk so that I can educate you about how this all works.    What do you think?   Thanks for sharing your time and thoughts.   Kind regards, Steve   ___________________________________ Steve Taggart Account Executive, Enterprise Solutions MBO Partners   t: 703.793.6014 f: 703.793.6452 e: staggart@mboenterprise.com &lt;mailto:staggart@mbopartners.com&gt; w: www.mboenterprise.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt;   Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
