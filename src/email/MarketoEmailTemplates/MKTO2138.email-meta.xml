Subject: Re: MBO Partners Information Thanks, Nicolette. That makes sense, but on page 1 of the Summary of Coverage it states:

&quot;To become insured for Supplemental Life Insurance coverage, certain requirements will need to be met. You can become insured for Supplemental Life Insurance in excess of $100,000 as long as you submit evidence of good health, and Aetna approves. If Aetna does not approve your evidence of good health, the amount of Supplemental Life Insurance will be limited to the Guaranteed Standard Issue amount.&quot;

Is HR saying that this statement only applies after the 30 days?On Wed, Sep 5, 2012 at 9:13 AM, Nicolette Taylor &lt;ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:ntaylor@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Hi Stephanie, This is the response I received back from my HR Support Team:  “If enrolling during their initial eligibility period (30 days after transition date), no EOI is needed, no matter the amount elected.  If enrolling outside of this period, an EOI is sometimes needed.  If the person is electing basic group life ($50k) no EOI is needed.   If the person already has supplemental and is electing to increase the value by $10k, no EOI is needed.  But If the person is electing supplemental for the first time, or is increasing the value by more than $10k, and EOI is needed. “  Basically, you are guaranteed coverage with no underwriting if any LI is elected in the first 30 days, and would only need EOI if it is past the 30 days and are electing more than $10,000 in supplemental coverage then the EOI is needed and will be sent to the insurance company for approval. Please let me know if you have any additional questions about this. Thanks!Nicolette  From: stephanie johnson [mailto:sjohnson8933@gmail.com &lt;mailto:sjohnson8933@gmail.com&gt;]

Subject: Re: MBO Partners Information Thanks for the information, Nicolette. I was reading over some of the paperwork regarding benefits, and had a question about the life insurance. On the MBO Life and Disability overview and rates sheet, it said that you offered guaranteed issue of both life ($50,000) and supplemental life insurance (up to $250,000). The Aetna summary of coverage mentioned the need to submit evidence of good health to go over the Guaranteed Standard Issue, which I believe is $100,000. I guess my question is, between the basic life insurance and the supplemental life insurance, how much of it is the guaranteed issue, with no medical underwriting required? From what I&apos;ve read it seems to be $50,000 for the basic, and $100,000 for the supplemental, but I wanted to make sure I was understanding that correctly.

If you could help clarify this for us, I&apos;d appreciate it. I just want to make sure we understand your policies. 

I did schedule a phone call with you regarding this for Wed morning because I wasn&apos;t sure if email was a good way to contact you, but if you can answer this question via email, you don&apos;t need to call me tomorrow morning.

Thank you so much for your time!
