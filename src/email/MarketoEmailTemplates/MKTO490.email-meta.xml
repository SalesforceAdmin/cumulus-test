Yes, we can set your company up as a ‘client’ and we would bill your company; you would pay us, we would then pay the workers you have on project.  The key part of this is the type of workers that you send us and the manner in which the rate is negotiated with them.  We only work with workers who understand what it is like being a consultant or are willing to learn.  Because we withhold both employer and employee taxes from the amount you pay us to pay the workers, they need to understand this would be the equivalent of them having to do their own taxes with their CPA.  
 
All of our group benefits that would be offered to these workers are listed here: http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-exec-group-benefits-2012.   Once someone signs up the benefits begin the first of the month following the activation date. 
 
Lastly, you do not have to run all your profit through us, you would simply pay the invoices for the workers compensation that you placed.    Further, the workers would only be paid when you paid, no sooner.  This is why it is important that they think of themselves like consultants (paid when paid).
 
Regards,
 
Steve

My wife and I own a small company where we receive payments from many different sources.  However, we have no time to really manage what I consider to be the back office items (401K, health insurance, etc).  I was hoping to find an employer of record where I could setup a relationship between MBO and my company.  I do realize that you all make your profit from the 5% fee, but I do not need or want to run all the money from my business through this process.  However, we are in the process of expanding our consulting business, and I like the option to have the consultants setup with MBO vs 1099.  Also, when is the health insurance renewal date for MBO?

Typically 50-70k a year; but there is no firm rule.  We just want to make sure people in the program are the right fit, for both sides.

Dear Rodney,

It’s been some time since we last spoke, but I appreciate your interest in working with MBO Partners, and wanted to check in and share some news with you.

We recently launched a new Web site with a set of powerful tools built-in to help those assessing and getting ready for independent work to find their right fit. 

I wanted to share these tools with you personally, and encourage you to take a quick look.

Perhaps you are happily independent now, and have found a solution to manage your business life -- or you may have returned to working full time, or perhaps be in the midst of a search.

Whatever your work life stage, I hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independence in America has arrived, with a  workforce 16 million strong, and predicted to grow to more than 20 million by 2013. Our company well into a year-long journey to better understand and celebrate independent work in our nation, called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view the site&apos;s very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.

I do hope you will take time to learn if MBO Partners is right for you or not. Please stay in touch and let me know how I can help further your career. Parting thought: do you already know that number-one challenge or opportunity I can help you with?

Steve Arhancet
