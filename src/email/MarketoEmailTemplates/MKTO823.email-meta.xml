Sara,
 
Thanks for the information. I will take a look this afternoon. It may answer a few lingering question I have. 
 
I think I am nearly to the point of making a decision, I just want to make sure I am more clear on how I would work with others under the agreement - whether as a subcontractor for someone else, or using others as subcontractors. In a purely legal since MBO would be the subcontractor to the client and you would be our employee for tax purposes.
 
We are also looking at licensing the use of some of our tools. I imagine that we would collect license fees from those types of partners as we would via other &quot;clients&quot; - through the MBO billing process. I need more detail on this before giving a complete answer. What tools would you be licensing, how much money would you plan on making from  these fees? Can you give me  a real life example? Is it per transaction or something along the lines of if x happens you pay us 10k? Just want to get a feel for this.
 
Tom

Steve,
 
Thanks for the invitation. I am currently considering MBO Partners, but I think one of the differences between our situation and the target audience is that we have been in business for 6 years. There is no question that we are ready to go solo.
 
Do you have any webinars tailored to existing companies/brands and their migration to the MBO infrastructure?
 
Tom
