    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

It’s been some time since we last spoke, but I appreciate your interest in working with MBO Partners, and wanted to check in and share some news with you.

We recently launched a new Web site (www.mbopartners.com) with a set of powerful tools built-in to help those assessing and getting ready for independent work to find their right fit (http://www.mbopartners.com/#rightforyou). 

I wanted to share these tools with you personally, and encourage you to  take a quick look.

Perhaps you are happily independent now, and have found a solution to  manage your business life -- or you may have returned to working full  time, or perhaps be in the midst of a search.

Whatever  your work life stage, I hope you can join me in celebrating the news  that independence in America has arrived, with a  workforce 16 million  strong, and predicted to grow to more than 20 million by 2013.   Our company well into a year-long journey to better understand and  celebrate independent work in our nation, called The State of Independence in America (http://info.mbopartners.com/the-state-of-independence.html). I encourage you to view the site&apos;s very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.

I do hope you will take time to learn if MBO Partners is right for you or not (http://www.mbopartners.com/#rightforyou). Please stay in touch and let me know how I can help further your career.   Parting thought: do you already know that number-one challenge or opportunity I can help you with?
