    <subject>Thanks for Requesting the MBO Partners Independent Workforce Index</subject>
    <textOnly>Thank you for your interest in the MBO Partners inaugural Independent Workforce Index. The study will be released in Sept 2011.
 
The summary findings are being prepared and should be available the week of Sept 5. We will be sure to share that with you as soon as it is available.
 
Thanks again for your interest in the state of independence in America.
 
We hope you will consider joining us as we begin a year-long journey to understand, and better support, the 16-million-strong independent workforce in our nation.
