Subject: Re: SNC Lavalin_Harry Parsons_MBO Agreement Good morning Sara, Following up since this is my first time with MBO...I believe I&apos;ve jumped all the hurdles in front of me so far, if I missed any let me know. I left a voicemail with Mark Best yesterday just before lunch to follow up and see if there were any questions on SNC&apos;s side.  Was there any comment on the contract changes?  I am assuming I&apos;m also waiting on drug screening and background check results. Thanks for all your help in this process. Harry Parsons973-296-4631On Thu, Mar 29, 2012 at 4:07 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Dear Mark, On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with you and your organization.  I have reviewed the agreement and enclosed the revised version with our information and suggested changes.  Here are the list of changes and explination for each one: 
	- 2nd  Paragraph - Due to our role as an employer or record for tax purposes and not that of a staffing agency we have not vetted the skills of the subcontraor thus, we need to put “to the best of our knowelege” in this section. 	- Section 3 – Since you will remit paymen to us once your client remits payment to you we would like to ask what the net payment terms are that you have in place with your client?	- Section 5 Indemnity - We prefer to use our standard indemnity language. 
 If you are curious about MBO Partners and what we do and how we work, we have a short one page overview that may answer some of your questions, which you may access by going here.I look forward to working with you,   Best regards, Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
