Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Gary Ham Sara, You missed the tag line - just a bit of a pun involved. It is &quot;Grandpa can do IT!&quot;    Please note the capitalization of the final word (geek that I am).    :-) As for the Contract vehicle, I may just try it at some point,  but I think most of the Gov guys would want the hourly rate and work category pre-established.  Do you have examples (names and rate redacted) that would show someone who has done what you suggest below? Respectfully,  Gary Ham &lt;http://grandpaham.com&quot;&gt;http://grandpaham.com703-899-6241   On Feb 14, 2012, at 6:20 PM, Sara Conde wrote:Hi Gary, My name is Sara Conde and I am helping out Steve. I wanted to introduce myself and address your email below. First and foremost I want to thank you for referencing MBO on your site, we really appreciate that. I also wanted to let you know I love the way you have branded yourself and the tagline “Grandpa Can  Do It” is great. We are on the GSA schedule so if you wanted to use MBO with government work you would simply bid on the work, get awarded the BPA, then reference MBO as your contract vichael via our GSA #.  I have attached some more information on this. Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Take care!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Gary Ham Steven, I am doing just fine on my own at the moment (actually for the last 5 years).  I once considered you as an option.  In fact, I still have you as a link at  &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9Z2hhbUBncmFuZHBhaGFtLmNvbSZ1aWQ9MCZleHRyYT1NVEU0ZkhOeVkybGtQVE0wTUh4dFlXbHNhV1E5TTJSalpHVTJaVGd0TkRNeE9DMDBZell3TFdJME9ETXRaRFl4TWpSbU56RTNPV0kzTFRNME1IeG1jbTl0UFhOamIyNWtaVUJ0WW05d1lYSjBibVZ5Y3k1amIyMThjM1ZpYWoxU1JUb2dUVUpQSUZCaGNuUnVaWEp6SUM4Z1IyRnllU0JJWVcwPT0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;http://grandpaham.com?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCfFlYuGdx%2Bf2XJrnslzTNNJunttYXY52MuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&quot;&gt;grandpaham.com as an option for any prime contractors or Gov&apos;t type who would be queasy dealing with an independent.   I might also be interested at some point in selling through you, if you had an IT contract vehicle of some sort the a Government manager could use with reasonable ease.  That I would be willing to talk personally about.  I am an IT consultant, Primarily software architecture and design, although I am a pretty good Java programmer as well.  It is all on my web site (although I do need to update the resume a bit). I am also an accountant/comptroller by original training (which is why I do not fear such things as taxes or bookkeeping).  It is kind of fun to keep my hand in. R/s Gary Hamhttp://grandpaham.com&lt;span style=&apos;mso-bookmark:_MailOriginal&gt;703-899-6241   On Feb 14, 2012, at 9:30 AM, Steve Arhancet wrote:
