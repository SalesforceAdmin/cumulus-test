The last step is logging into MBO Access &lt;https://access.mbopartners.com/&gt; and completing the “Industry Expertise” and “Disciplines” sections of your profile. You can do this by clicking on your name in the upper right hand corner and then clicking on “Edit profile &amp; privacy.” This information needed for our workmen’s comp. policy and must be completed before I can activate your account and get you billing.  Your user ID and password is the same as your MBO Business Center. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,Sara
