I agree, a guide would be helpful and I have escalated this to our department head. I would just enter our address and put “attention Sara Conde” that way it will come directly to me and will seem more official. I can scan in anything that comes and email to you. How does that work for you?
Thanks,
Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: MBO Exec since date, etc. Thank you, Sara, Depending on the circumstances, when entering an address for MBO Partners, I take it I can use my own address. I hope to someday be officially &quot;doing business as some company&quot;. I&apos;m thinking that may simplify things but then maybe not. I wish there was some kind of guide for this sort of thing. Hoping to be working again soon.  Bruce Hankins

Subject: MBO Exec since date, etc. Good morning Sara, In my Business Center and elsewhere I am said to be an MBO Exec since 01/09/2012 with a Status of Alumni. It used to say since 07/?/2002 which would be correct. When a prospective employer or state employment agency, etc., calls and asks about my employment with MBO Partners what are they told?  Bruce Hankins
