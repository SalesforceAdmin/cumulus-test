Thank you for following up!  I will follow up with you in the new year, but if in the meantime you would like more information on MBO or decide that working with us is the direction you want to take, please do not hesitate to reach out to me and I will be happy to assist you.
 
If I do not speak with you before then, have a great holiday season!
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Nicolette,
I am not sure we are a fit for MBO since we are trying to build a brand.
I will reach out to you, if it makes sense in the future or you can call in January.
Regards,
David
