    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Associate}},

MBO Partners is looking for volunteers to be featured on our Meet The Independents &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/meet-the-independents.html&gt; site, representing {{company.State:default=your state}}. The site features consultant profiles that are shared with MBO&apos;s large online audience and distributed in monthly newsletters reaching more than 20,000 business professionals.

It&apos;s a great brand awareness opportunity for your business, and if you&apos;re selected, we will send you a $50 Amazon gift card as our way of saying thanks!
