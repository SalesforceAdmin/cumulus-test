Sara, 
At this time, I am back on the City payroll.  The contract should now reflect only only the two &apos;revised&apos; service dates in Rockville. The three dates in Washington, DC were withdrawn in a discussion I had late last week with Eugenia (client rep) inasmuch as I can&apos;t charge her for private work inside the city (DC gov policy).

Subject: RE: Proposal and Scope Requests for Contract Preparation and COI Request Hi Sam, Hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to follow up on the paperwork since I am back in the office today. Along with further explanation on why the warranty section is not applicable I do want to clarify that Russell will not be providing electronic copies of his presentations to the Tower Company as this is his and MBO’s IP.  I was reading over section 12 in the contract and I wanted to make sure this was clear. Thanks,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: Proposal and Scope Requests for Contract Preparation and COI Request Hi Sam, I heard back from my legal on section 17 and we are confused as how this would not apply. It states that if you are not happy with Russell’s work you could come back and have us replace it for up to a year after the work is completed. Can you give me additional reasoning as to why this doesn’t apply so I can go back to them? As a heads up I will be out Thursday and Friday returning on Monday the 12th.  Thank you,

Subject: Proposal and Scope Requests for Contract Preparation and COI Request Good Afternoon Sara, Attached is the latest proposal from Russell Klein for presentations at 5 buildings, this has increased from the original 4.   We will need these on your letterhead and would prefer that each building address’ proposal be on one page to be used as Exhibit A.  Also, the scope is on Russell’s letterhead and we will need that on yours as well for the scope of work as additional Exhibit A information. Regarding the contract and your requests: We will of course change the name on the contract to MBO Partners, Inc.   We will be able to change section 10 to “Either party” instead of Owner and “fifteen (15) days)” instead of the five (5) days on the contract. As far as the paragraphs that do not apply, they will not come into play if they are not applicable and therefore we  see no need to remove them from the contract. Our payment terms are 45 days and we will not be able to make a change in paragraph 4.   Regarding paragraph 18, section a, we are unable to make any changes.   We will complete your Work Order Addendum and it will become part of Exhibit A. We also need a certificate of insurance for the properties where Russell Klein will be making presentation, per the attached instructions for each property. We will begin making the changes in the contract that we can and once we have the proposal and scope of work on letterhead, we will attach as Exhibit A.  As soon as we have everything completed, we will send the contracts to you for signature. Let me know, if we can be of assistance. Thanks,Sam     Sam HilderbrandAssociate Property Manager2000 Tower Oaks Blvd., Ninth Floor Rockville, Maryland 20852Main: 301.984.7000   Direct: 301.692.1496  Fax: 301.692.1570   sam.hilderbrand@towercompanies.comwww.towercompanies.comP Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail. From: Sara Conde [mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;tel:301.984.7000&gt;]

Subject: RE: contract agreements Dear Steve,  On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with you and your organization.  I have reviewed the agreement and enclosed the revised version with our information.  I have included a copy that lists our changes attached.   Here are the list of changes and explination for each one: 
	- Entire Agreement –needs to be between Tower Companies and MBO Partners, Inc. 
 
	- Section 4 – Payment terms – we prefer payment terms of net 30 days as this is industry standard. 
 
	- Section 17 – Warranty -   Due to our role as an employer or record for tax purposes and not that of a staffing agency we can not agree to this warrenty. We can agree that work will be done in a professional workmen like manner. 
 
	- Section 10 Termination – We need the ability to cancel an engagement if we receive the intent to resign from the assigned consultant and we prefer 15 days written notice as this is industry standard. 
 
	- Section 18a - Indemnity - We prefer to use our standard indemnity language. 

 
	- Exhibit A – We will place this on MBO letterhead to be consistant with the contract and send over.  Also, we ask that you complete and add the attached SOW to the agreement. 
 We need these same chagnes in each agreement for each buliding.  If you are curious about MBO Partners and what we do and how we work, we have a short one page overview that may answer some of your questions, which you may access by going here.I look forward to working with you,   Best regards, Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
