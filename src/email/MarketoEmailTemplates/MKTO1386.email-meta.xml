You don’t lose the deduction, it’s just not as convenient as running the expense through us – just do it on your own.  We actually used to allow our members to write this off, but we had so many people who were submitting the expense without actually qualifying (since we have no way of easily substantiating).   If you need to get on a W2 for your client, we are going to be – without question the best way to net the most.  You won’t find another service that will allow you to take business and medical deductions on a W2 and you certainly won’t find one that lets you retain more of your rate after tax caps are hit.  Feel free to search around and talk with other umbrella companies – we’ll be here once you realize how strong our value prop is. Other perks:1.       Retirement plan (401k and Roth 401k)2.       If you do any brokering or contract placements, we can pay the workers you place, collect their time, invoice, etc..3.       Professional Insurances (business, E&amp;O) – when you use us you don’t have to carry these anymore. Take care,Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: thanks Hi Sara,   Thanks for connecting through Linkedin.  My concerns regarding your model are legitimately claim a home office deduction , I don’t like the w-2 vs 1099 aspect and 5% is too much in my estimation.   If this looks like the best alternative I will circle back with you. Thanks, Steve</textOnly>
