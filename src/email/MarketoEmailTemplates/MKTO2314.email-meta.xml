Subject: Contact Sara, you will be contacted by a former colleague of mine next week.  He was interested in the arrangement that I have with MBO and is himself an independent.  He hadn’t thought the insurance coverage aspect and was impressed when I shared with him what you all cover for me.  Hope it works out. Debra McReavy, R.N.Turning Leaf Healthcare ConsultingPO Box 593St. Albans, MO 63073 Cell:  (636) 346-7050Visit me on the web at:  turningleafhealthcare.com Debra.McReavy@att.net &lt;mailto:Debra.McReavy@att.net&gt;  </textOnly>
