Subject: Re: MBO Partners Inquiry Hi Nicolette, Thank you for your answer. I would be happy to discuss with you, however it would have to be sooner than next week (as per your schedule). I am leaving my position on Friday and I need to get some kind of contract with them before I move to the US next week.I was looking into the sole proprietorship route and I think you would be able to help me with the contract wording, invoicing and tax issues. Is there anything else I should consider? I was also curious to understand the advantages of setting up a LLC compared to a sole proprietorship. Is there any tax benefits I should consider?Also could you please let me know your fees? I am happy to communicate by email if that&apos;s easier for you.Thank you Kind regardsSophieOn Tue, Mar 27, 2012 at 7:47 PM, Nicolette Taylor &lt;ntaylor@mbopartners.com&gt; wrote:  Dear Sophie,  Thank you for the inquiry you submitted at the MBO Partners website.  I wanted to introduce myself as the person at MBO Partners responsible for all new associate and partnership requests. I’ll be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services and answer any specific questions you may have.   Per your questions about your tax situation, our HR team said that as long as you are working in the US and paying US taxes under a US Social Security Number then we can allow you to work under our program.  I will still need to have a conversation with you to explain how the program works to ensure it will be a good fit for you, but we do function similarly to some of the “umbrella” companies you are familiar with. You may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here. You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube. I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners! Nicolette  ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
