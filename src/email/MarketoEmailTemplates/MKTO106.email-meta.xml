It looks like all changes were agreed to that I proposed, which is great news.  
 
Can you please confirm these are okay for us to execute and send back?
 
Thanks,
 
Steve

Deepak,
 
Sorry for the double email.  I just realized I only have the PDF versions of the contract.  If you would like to reflect the below changes and send to me or I can do them if you provide the .doc version of the contracts. 
 
Thanks in advance. 
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Hi Steve,
Sorry.
1)      The term changes are OK. We can make them.
2)      There is some risk going forward. I have left Wayne a email and phone calls and have not heard back. He is supposed to be getting some key paperwork to the client and no communication back – frustrating. See attached. But I know thaty is not your problem – just gets in the way J
Unless of course all my contact info is wrong J

Hi Steve,
I would also like about 15-30 minutes to chat one on one to share some background and understand your business also so we can make sure the customer experience is only better than before.

Gena, 
 
Thank you for revising this and sending it back.  MBO Partners is a corporate platform for consultants who find their own work and engagements.  Contractors and freelancers use MBO in lieu of self-incorporating.  They have the umbrella of a W2 environment but retain all the same tax benefits they would have if they were self-employed. With over 20 years of experience administering professional contract workers, MBO understands the complexities of co-employment and 1099 risk.  We mitigate tax-related contractor risks by making it easy for independent consultants to take advantage of our W-2 employment program.  Through our program, they gain access to a high quality benefits package as well as a full suite of business processing services. We carry comprehensive business insurances, including General Liability, Errors and Omissions, and Workers’ Compensations policies that our Associates are covered under. If you would like a more in-depth view of our services, please visit www.mbopartners.com.
 
I have reviewed the Master Independent Contractor Agreement and WP Independent Contractor Project Addendum-D for the extension of the Lockheed Martin Project.  There are just a few modifications we would suggest making in addition to the name change:
 
·         # Warranty (7c):  Insert the following language into 7c
 
The services provided by Contractor shall be performed in a professional manner, and by the best efforts of contractor shall be of a high grade, nature, and quality. The services shall be performed in a timely manner and shall meet deadlines agreed between Contractor and the Company.
 
·         #8 Indemnity:  Replace with the following language:
 
Contractor agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Company and its successors, officers, directors, agents and employees harmless from MBO’s status as an Independent Contractor, payment of employment taxes, trademark or patent infringement, and property damage or bodily injury, including death due to the negligence of MBO
 
We prefer to use our standard indemnity language.  
 
·         #10 Non-Solicitation and Other Activities: Add the following language to the end of the section:
 
The terms of this paragraph are agreed to with the exception of existing relationships with Clients or relationships developed with Client outside of the services being performed under this Agreement
 
We have thousands of clients whom we already have master service agreements with, all pre-existing relationships that were formed prior to this agreement.  We also start new relationships outside of those related to these services.  We want to be clear that those relationships do not put us in violation with this portion of the contract.  We are also not a staffing or consulting firm.  We are a financial services company designed for Independent Consultants.
 
Lastly, I have our insurance certificates being sent directly from our Broker, Jill Otto.  You should receive them tomorrow.
 
Best regards,
 
Steven Arhancet

Hi Steve,
 
Deepak asked that I do add into the Project Addendum that Wayne is the only approved resource for this project. Other than that, it’s all the same just changed to MBO Partners. Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!

Gena,
 
Thank you for taking my call this afternoon.  It was nice speaking with you and figuring this out. 
Enclosed is our W9 and ACH (if that is possible, if not that’s okay too). 
I’ll wait to hear back from you on the proper contract and we can go from there. 
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Hi Wayne,
 
Attached is a new Master Agreement (because of the date extension) and a Project Addendum with Addendum (J) for the next proposed phase for Lockheed Martin. Please sign, scan and return all pages of each document.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me or Navin. Thanks!
