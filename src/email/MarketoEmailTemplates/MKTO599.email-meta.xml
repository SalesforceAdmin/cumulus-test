Thanks for the reply, we do not offer much up in the way of assisting you finding your first contract; I will however tell you that 90% of consultants find their first project through their natural market.  Formulate a really amazing message that you can send to your colleauges, peers, contacts informing them of what you do and that you are looking for work; the activity that spawns from that will usually end up in your first contract. 
 
It goes against the thinking that you’ll find the first contract through a job board or some other service; but it is how it usually works out.  If you still find trouble finding a contract; you can always try and work through a staffing firm that specializes in the type of skills you have and telling them up-front you want to work 1099 versus as an employee of them.
 
Good luck and I hope you find something.  As soon as you do, is a great time to reach out to me for how to process it.
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Steve,
I hope you had a wonderful holiday season.  One of my resolutions for 2012 is to officially start my SDVOSB consulting business.  Any help generating leads and advertising my services would be very much appreciated.
 
Warmest Regards,
Erik &quot;Skip&quot; Moratzka

Dear Erik,
Along the way, you shared with us that you have considered independent consulting as a career path. We appreciate your interest in our company and the topic of independence. It&apos;s a subject we are passionate about.
Each year, we observe a surge in interest around the topic just after the holidays from connections new and old. You may be interested in participating in our pre-New-Years Webinar:

Or just reading about our point of view in a recent posting we did.
