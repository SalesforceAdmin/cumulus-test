It was a pleasure speaking with you today.  I’ve enclosed a few items we spoke about
 
1.       Expense policy
2.       Expense list (most common types of expenses you can submit through us)
3.       Link to our group benefit plan details:  http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-exec-group-benefits
4.       Estimate showing you what your income would look like running through MBO
5.       Summary of benefits
 
I’ll follow up with you next week.  I’ll have my fingers crossed for you and MBO on this contract J
