I believe you must have seen the email to you (of a day or two ago)
from Sara Conde of MBO Partners who will be handling my back office,
billing, and insurance.

I realize this is a bit late to be raising this question, but is it
possible for the Bank to contract with MBO Partners on my behalf? For
these 35 days?

Another option is for me to sign the assignment letter as is, and
designate MBO Partners as the payee in lieu of myself (when I send any
invoices).

I would prefer the first idea, and I would imagine also that there
would be some benefits to the Bank in contracting that way, as I would
not be designated a WB staff member (subject to all those staff
restrictions and requirements) even though I would be a STA.

I know you don&apos;t want to be bothered with this kind of matter, but the
email from &quot;hrloa&quot; said that, if I had any questions or issues about
the proposed contract, that I should contact my &quot;Task Manager&quot;, which
is you, no?

That doesn&apos;t mean you need to deal with this yourself, but please pass
my question on to the person (in Human Resources/Contracting) that can
answer the question.

Meanwhile, I am continuing full bore on my work.

Best,
Alan
