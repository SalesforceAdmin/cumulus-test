Thank you for requesting more information after our  How Much Could You Charge? webinar. We created this resource guide &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Bill-rate%20Articles-Cover-FINAL.pdf&gt; that includes more information on MBO Partners and additional  in-depth educational resources covering bill rate topics. 
We have also added you to our Independent Consulting Brief (monthly newsletter packed with education, tips and resources) and Independent Consultant Webinar Series email lists.

If you have any questions, or would simply like to learn more about how MBO can help you along your journey to becoming self-employed, please contact me at any time by email. You can also easily schedule a time for us to connect via my online schedule by going here: {{lead.EM TTLink:default=edit me}}

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you!
