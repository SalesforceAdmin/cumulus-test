    <subject>Ready to charge $300 an hour? Visit MBO’s new and improved bill rate calculator and guide</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Consultant}},

We have some exciting news here at MBO Partners. One of our most popular tools, the bill rate calculator &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/#billrate&gt;, has been upgraded! We have made it easier for you to find the hourly rate you should be charging your clients.

Check it out today and you’ll have the opportunity to download the new 20-page bill rate resource guide!

We also launched a monthly Independent Consulting Brief &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independent-consulting-brief&gt; this past April, which is a great way to stay up-to-date on our webinar schedules, blogs, events and more.
 
Regards,
