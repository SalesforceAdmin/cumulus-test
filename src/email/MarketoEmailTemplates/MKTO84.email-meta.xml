Thanks for your email reply.  There is one last step in the process of setting up your account, that is the I9 Form that I mentioned.  I’ve enclosed the packet with the I9 form and also the example on the page before it on how it should be completed.  Be sure to follow the example exactly (any errors and I have to get you to re-do it).  You’ll need to take this to a notary and have them sign (no actual seal is required) in section two and you sign in front of them in section one. I’ll also need a copy of your Photo ID in your passport when you fax your I9 Back (be sure the picture is clear when you scan/copy it).  
 
Once I have this document I’ll activate your account and have the funds deposited.  Do you think you’ll have a chance to do this today?
 
The password to open the file is the first four numbers of your address.
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Hi Steve,
 
Sorry for the delay . . . things have just been crazy between travel, work and having my 6-year old grandson for the summer (not much gets done when he’s around J).  I have FINALLY gone in and set up my account and now need to do the expense portion.  Can the money just sit in my business center until I am ready to invoice?  How does that work?
 
Maybe we can touch base on Monday to discuss.
 
Thanks for your patience!
 
Tricia

Tricia,
 
Unexpectedly, we received payment for you today for the work you did with EMP.  We however cannot pay you until you enroll in our system.  We will unfortunately have to send this money back to Atrium and wait for you to enroll, at which time we will request for them to repay the invoice we send.  
 
Can you please let me know when you plan to finish your enrollment?  If we can finish your enrollment today or Monday at the latest, we can have this deposited in your business center, but any longer and it will need to be sent back. 
 
I will call you as well.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
