&nbsp;
<div>MBO Partners is taking one more step on its journey to profile independence in America, and we&rsquo;re first asking for your help, before we reach outside our doors.</div>
&nbsp;
<div><strong>As a part of our State of Independence in American campaign, we will be showcasing independent workers from each of the fifty states.</strong> Each story and iconic commissioned photograph will be part of a spread and story that will begin online at our State of Independence site, and will culminate next summer in a commemorative book celebrating the dawn of a new era of independent work in our nation.</div>
&nbsp;
<div><strong>We&rsquo;d like to include MBO associate stories, state by state, and profession by profession, so the world can see what we already know: independent workers are experts, productive, influential and &hellip; just plain interesting! They are somebody every business and company needs on their dream team. </strong></div>
&nbsp;
<div><strong>An MBO associate from California, Bryan Forman, will be our first profile &ndash;</strong> he&rsquo;ll be sharing his story and his independence photo moment. If you would like to follow in his footsteps, or suggest another peer as a potential profilee, please email our Marketing Specialist, Jaime Buckley at <a title="Jaime Buckley" href="mailto:jbuckley@mbopartners.com">jbuckley@mbopartners.com</a>, to be considered for this exciting opportunity. She can share additional details about the program.</div>
