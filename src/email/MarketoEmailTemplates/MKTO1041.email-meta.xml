Subject: RE: MBO Partners InformationHi Jeff, We do not offer a lower fee for people who do not need benefits because the cost of benefits is separate from the services we provide.  The benefits are all a la carte so you get to choose which you use if any and if you choose to elect any of them you would pay the monthly premium for those insurances.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Thank you and have a great day,Nicolette  ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: mailto:jeff_roush@hotmail.com &lt;http://bbentley%40mbopartners.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
