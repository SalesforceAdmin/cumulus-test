We do offer access to group benefits.  I have attached our 2011 benefits link for your review. http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-exec-group-benefits 
 
In order for the consultants to join our group benefits they have to be eligible to join our MBO Exec program and work in this program.  In order for them to be eligible I would have to have a conversation with each individual to determine if they are a good fit for our program.  I would be happy to explain the program to you in detail if you have questions about how it works and what the program has to offer an independent consultant.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions and I would be happy to assist you.
 
Have a great day,
Nicolette

Dear Nicolette,
 
Thank you for the contact. My request is very simple. I would like to know if you are able to offer any kind of group insurance to four contractors in different states?
 
The states in question are NE, NJ, and CT.
 
Please let me know if you have such plan or if you have a referral. 
 
This is the only service I need for now. I do however help manage a group of 50 plus independent contractors for the two companies I run. 
 
Thank you!
