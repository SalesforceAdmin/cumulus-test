I went ahead and created an updated estimate for you (attached) for this project just to refresh your memory on how MBO works and for your records. It assumes $157.50 per hour, 40 hrs. a week, fully maximized 401(k), and $500 a month in operating expenses. If you have any questions about this, would like to see another version, and/or review this via phone please let me know. Please confirm that you will NOT need MBO to hold a clearance for this work (as this would add an additional percentage to the MBO fee).  The last step is logging into MBO Access &lt;https://access.mbopartners.com/&gt; and completing the “Industry Expertise” and “Disciplines” sections of your profile. This information needed for our workmen’s comp. policy and must be completed before I can activate your account and get you billing.  Your user ID and password is the same as your MBO Business Center. Please let me know if you have any questions.
