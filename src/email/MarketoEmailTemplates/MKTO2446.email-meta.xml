Subject: Re: Acct Manager for potential contract work needed Hi Nicolette:

I wanted to obtain some information from you on engaging MBO for my next
contract. I&apos;ve not worked with MBO since 2010, so some things may have
changed.  I am hoping I&apos;ll have an offer to start a contract coming in next
week. (and then start date would be 2 weeks after that I suspect)

I need some information on the admin fees and such so I can look at my
asking bill rate, as well establish a point of contact so if (when) things
are finalized I can get you in touch with the contract company
(TrainingPros) so we can get an agreement for a Corp to Corp created.

I can be reached at 404-281-4553 &lt;tel:404-281-4553&gt;.  Thanks very much!

Subject: Acct Manager for potential contract work needed Hi Heather:

I&apos;m not sure this will get to you with your new last name. I also sent a message through LinkedIn.

I hope you are well. It&apos;s been a while and it looks like you&apos;ve been very successful at MBO. I&apos;m delighted to see that! 

I wanted to get in touch as I may have a contract job I want to run through MBO. Can you provide a person for me to chat with? It would be with TrainingPros, the company I worked with last time.

Thanks very much!

Kelly
