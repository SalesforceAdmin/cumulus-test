We had a time schedule to talk and after looking through my email history I am not sure how but it seems as though we were never able to connect. We have a program called “MBO Access” that is open to our Alumni. You can learn more about it by clicking here &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Access_Information.pdf&gt;. If you are interested in joining please let me know and I will get you set up with an account. Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!
