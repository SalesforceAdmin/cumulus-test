Hi Steven,
 
Thank you for reaching out to me.  I am no longer freelancing and run my own company now.  However, I was glad to have received your email.  I looked at your site to confirm if it is indeed what I thought your services was about and forwarded it over to my friend who I feel can benefit from MBO.  I asked him to sign up for the webinar.
 
Thank you for reaching out.
 
-William
