Unfortunately I am leaving at 1pm today but I will be in the office all day tomorrow. Is there a good time for me to reach out? I know you are on a tight schedule…
 
Thanks Russell,
Sara

Hi Russell,
 
Thanks so much for sharing this with me. I took a look at it and ran it by my boss as he used to write these while he was consulting. We both agree it reads well and comes off very professional. I have some questions and comments that I redlined in the SOW. Give me a ring when you have a chance to chat. I will be leaving the office at 1pm today but will be back tomorrow at 9am so if you miss me just leave a voicemail or shoot me an email. 
 
Thanks Russell!
Sara

Sara,
 
Thank you so much for your enthusiastic support.
 
I learned long ago to do 90% of my project and THEN share it... just wasn&apos;t possible, this evening.
 
Thus, I&apos;m not sure this is quite far enough along to merit your looking at it just yet.
However, if you think I&apos;m moving in the right direction, I need to:
a) respond to client&apos;s primary request for 3 presentations
b) offer opportunity for broader project involving technical assistance to divisions throughout property ~~ a vision she mentioned, but is not yet ready to engage.
 
Note:  my modifications of the template used here end just before the Section Labelled &quot;Your Responsibilities.&quot;
 
Short, I know.  Sorry, I&apos;m juggling projects tonight.  I will be done shortly, and I DO have a meeting with my Chamber of Commerce mentor today (Tuesday) in which I&apos;ll be working to chop this into something usable, very quickly.  I&apos;ll send you that as well, assuming I&apos;ve also received your preliminary feedback.

Russell

Dear Sara,
 
Good afternoon.  I have a client lined up..!
 
A professional acquaintance has called me to request tenant/lessee presentations to three properties within her Property Management companies&apos; portfolio.  3 dates should take place and I&apos;ve promised this prospect a work proposal.
 
I&apos;d like to share it with you later today and discuss it&apos;s strengths, etc. as well as the appropriate price point.
While I need to turn this around by Wednesday, I am still waiting for her to answer some questions I requested from her own colleagues -- those managing these properties.
 
Hope to catch you later today.
 
Russell

Hi Russell,
 
I received your passport, thank you! The next step is to get me in touch with your client (when that becomes appropriate.) You are good to go from the MBO side.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
