However, it seems that you won’t be billing against that SOW until fall. If that is the case I will wait to activate the account until we approach that date.  Thanks,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
