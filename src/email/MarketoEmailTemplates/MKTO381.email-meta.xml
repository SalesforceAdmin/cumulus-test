    <textOnly>Hi Chris, Thank you for forwarding this information over.  Have you spoken with Shutterstock about working with MBO already and they are aware that I will be reaching out?  I wanted to find that out before I reached out to them out of the blue.  We can discuss this on our call tomorrow but if you have spoken with them and want me to send out something sooner could you please provide me with Michael&apos;s email address and I can send him a copy of our Master Service Agreement. Thank you and have a great evening, Nicolette ___________________________________ Nicolette Taylor Business Manager MBO Partners t: 703.793.6281 f: 703.793.6456 e: ntaylor@mbopartners.com w: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

The first step would be for me to be put in contact with their contracts department (or legal team, whomever handles contract negotiations) and I will work to get a Master Service Agreement in place.  I would also like to have a brief conversation with you to go over the enrollment process for you.
