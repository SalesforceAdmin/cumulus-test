Great thanks!  I spoke with Jay today and he was fine with the minimal changes and will send me back a clean copy with the changes made and MBO will then sign the contract.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  
 
Have a great evening,
Nicolette

Dear Jay,
 
Your agreement was forwarded to me regarding the engagement for Chris Bradham. Thank you for bringing one of our Associates on your engagement! I looked over your agreement and would like to request a few changes to accommodate our business model. Let me take a moment to explain our business so that you will understand the basis for the requested changes.
 
MBO Partners, Inc. is an &quot;umbrella company&quot;, specifically set up to administer contract assignments for independent consultants.  Individuals utilize our services in lieu of self-incorporating, and as such become our w2 employee. Our model avails them of many of the same benefits as self-incorporating but without the difficulties typically encountered in becoming a freelancer. For your purposes, we operate similarly to most of the staffing companies you may deal with, except that we do not recruit or find engagements for our consultants: they do that on their own. If you would like a more in-depth view of our services, please visit www.mbopartners.com. 
 
With this in mind, Ive attached an amended contract with the changes highlighted.  Here is an explanation of each change:
 
Section IX, i. Non-Compete - We are likely billing your client for other consultants.  What we typically do in this situation is add language to the end of the non-solicitation section, so that we are not in breach when our other members work at your clients.  
I have highlighted a few items that I would like to have a quick discussion with you so if you could please reach out to me at your earliest convenience that would be great.
 
Thanks again, and we look forward to working with you.  
 
 
Best regards,
 
 
Nicolette
