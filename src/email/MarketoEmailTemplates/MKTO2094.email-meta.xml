    <subject>Contractor Engagement Quarterly - Quarter 3</subject>
    <textOnly>Q3 FOCUS
Independent work is going mainstream &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/independent-work-goes-mainstream.html&gt;, but many organizations are still playing catch-up on their IC talent management strategy. That’s why we are launching an educational campaign &lt;http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/10/prweb10023080.htm&gt; across the country, while also introducing our first, free Contractor Engagement Quarterly. Each quarter, we’ll share the hot topics, insight on legal cases, noteworthy blogs and white papers featuring best practices for ensuring happy, engaged contract talent. By the decade’s end, half of all U.S. workers may be engaged independent of a single employer. Is your company ready?

TESTIMONIAL
“Initially when we started working with MBO over eight years ago it was to mitigate the risk associated with the Independent Contractors we deploy to our federal clients. Now we have learned we can depend on MBO because it has proven to be an effective way for us to engage Independent Contractors. The Contractors seem to be happy with the service they get, the business sees it as a streamlined way to get their talent to work and we still maintain our accepted vendor procurement practices.”

Education is the Key: Engaging Challenging Independent Workers
“By bringing IC engagement programs out from behind the curtain, having open dialogues and speaking in realistic terms, I think you can get professionals to understand and adopt your program.”
With the research that’s out today, and the turning tides of America’s workforce, I think enterprise organizations realize how important and critical a resource their independent contractors are. So why is there a hesitancy to implement programs that engage ICs properly?
