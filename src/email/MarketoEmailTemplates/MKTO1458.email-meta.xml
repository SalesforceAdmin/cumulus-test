Subject: Re: MBO Hi Nicolette,  Thanks for getting back to me.  I went through a long orientation process with Kelly and then got so busy that I didnt get the papers notarized and returned  to her.  Now the forms are a year old.  Id like to move forward with registering.  Is it possible to have a another set of documents sent to me?   MaryKay Penn
