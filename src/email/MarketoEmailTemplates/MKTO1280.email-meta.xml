I am usually in the office from 9:30 -6:30 ~7ish (it’s a great way to beat traffic.) So after hours would work for me almost any night including tomorrow.  Let me know what works for you.
Thanks,

Subject: Re: MBO Partners Thanks Sara, I clicked on the link, but none of your available times work well for me. I get into the office by 830 and leave by 530. I have no cell reception in the office so the ideal would be that we speak some time prior to or after business hours. Do you have a day that could accommodate that? If not, I&apos;l try to find a slot that works around meetings, but currently that has been tough. Thanks, Josh Greenberg | CRM Ventures | (215) 869-3356 | joshua@crmventures.comOn Thu, Apr 26, 2012 at 12:39 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com&gt; wrote:Hi Josh, Nice to meet you via email, any friend of Deepak’s is a friend of mine, and thank you Kelly for the wonderful introduction.  As Kelly mentioned below, you may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by go here.  You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube. I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners! Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: MBO Partners Hi Kelly, I was referred to you by a colleague of mine, Deepak Asrani, who raved about you and MBO Partners. I have just started consulting as an independent contractor for a pharma in NJ and wanted get a better understanding of MBO Services and fees (the website is quite a bit vague). Can you email me more in-depth details of your services and a breakdown of the fees? I have lousy cell reception in my office, but can call you around 6pm EST if you&apos;re available. Deepak gave me a number for you of 703-793-6025 &lt;tel:703-793-6025&gt;, is that still correct? Regards, Josh Greenberg </textOnly>
