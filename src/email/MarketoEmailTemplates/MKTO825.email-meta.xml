Thank you for completing the online enrollment. The last step is sending me a copy of your completed I-9.  You can find the I-9 form in your enrollment documents; you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.)  
 
Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.

Thanks!
Sara
