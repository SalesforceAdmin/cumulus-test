Thanks so much for keeping in touch and I will continue to do the same. Best of luck out there!Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; If you are in the DC area please check out our upcoming networking event! &lt;http://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/event?oeidk=a07e6cqaqtk0702919f&amp;llr=kp5x6qkab&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Mike Gallow Hi Sara,

The consulting contract got stuck.  The company&apos;s proposed contract was totally lop-sided and one way to their benefit.  In fact, it was not really an independent consulting contract (in my opinion).  It looked more like an employment agreement that an employee of the firm would sign.  I sent back a modified agreement, after consulting with a lawyer, and haven&apos;t heard back yet from them.

Thank you for keeping in touch.  I appreciate learning about MBO updates.  If the MBO&apos;s platform is updated to allow consultants to build a marketplace profile, I would be interested in hearing about that.  I&apos;m also on the lookout for any venues where consultants can band together to bid on projects.

I&apos;ve also begun reaching out to smaller non-profit organizations to offer my budgeting and analysis skills on an ad-hoc, as-needed basis.   I think many of them are going to find the environment is about to get a lot tougher in terms of executing the mission with reduced funding.  I am thinking that my business development and financial analysis experience growing a professional services firm might be useful to these organizations.

Take care and keep in touch.

Hello Mike,
I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?
Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
	- There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one:

	- MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, theres real hard facts about The State of Independence in America &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPXByb2QtbC00NDImbWVzc2FnZWlkPTQ0MiZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEzNDgyMjcxNTEmc2VyaWFsPTEyNjUwMzUyMTcmZW1haWxpZD1taWNoYWVsLmdhbGxvQHZhbGVyaXN5cy5jb20mdXNlcmlkPWwtMTI4LTI2MzgyLTk1OTY3LTEmZXh0cmE9JiYm&amp;&amp;&amp;http://info.mbopartners.com/stateofindependence?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvKjNZKXonjHpfsXx7uUrXrHr08Yy0EZ5VunJEUWy2YEDRdQhcOuuEwcWGog8zQ5X&gt; that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent.

Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.
