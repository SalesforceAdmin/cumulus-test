Unfortunetly, it has to be notary. We have a list of notary’s that we know will work with us, you can find that list here. &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9dHBlb3BsZXMxQGhvdG1haWwuY29tJnVpZD0wJmV4dHJhPU1UTXdmSE55WTJsa1BUTTBNSHh0WVdsc2FXUTlaRGRtT1RNM1pUa3RaR0l3TkMwMFpqTTFMVGt4WkRNdE9ERmxOamhsTnpjd01XVXlMVE0wTUh4bWNtOXRQWE5qYjI1a1pVQnRZbTl3WVhKMGJtVnljeTVqYjIxOGMzVmlhajFTUlRvZ1RVSlBJRkJoY25SdVpYSnpJRVZ1Y205c2JHMWxiblFnU1c1bWIzSnRZWFJwYjI0PT0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.mbopartners.com/notaries?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCb0Fculd67u%2FIAqHiizjBc5TmuLNwY52MuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&gt;  I do want to clarify what MBO is asking the notary to do. Section 2 of the I-9 form is for the employer or &quot;authorized representative&quot; of the employer to sign in the case of a remote hire (such as yours). Because you are a remote hire, we are asking a notary to act as the authorized representative for MBO because we deem them as a &quot;person of trust&quot; it is completely up to them whether or not they choose to act in this capacity for us.  When they sign and date the document they can sign as an “authorized representative” (if they prefer) for their title and there is no need for any kind of notary stamp. They are simply witnessing a signature. We are not asking them to notarize the form (which does go against notary law in several states.) We do provide an Instruction letter to notaries &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_I-9_Instructions_to_Authorized_Representatives.pdf&gt; that explains this.  Understandably (and unfortunately) a lot of confusion occurs when we ask a notary to sign and date a form as an authorized representative because they have the “position of trust” that a notary carries (but not to notarize the document or act in an official notary capacity on the document.)  It’s like asking an office notary to sign for a package (because you trust them) but not to notarize the document stating they received the package.  Bottom line, I feel your pain, I know this is extremely frustrating.  However, we need to follow this process to be in compliance with USCIS E-Verify &lt;http://www.dhs.gov/e-verify&gt; program.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!
