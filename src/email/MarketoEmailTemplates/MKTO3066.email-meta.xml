I looked into Michael Larkin’s account set up with MBO and unfortunately we are no longer offering that particular set up structure. We froze this offering due to changes in the health care law related to the Affordable Care Act. We are exploring a new program that will accommodate some of these changes and that will likely be ready in the fall of 2014. I can certainly inform you when that program is available but unfortunately for now we are not able to provide you with the services you are looking for.  I would like to refer you to a P.E.O. (professional employer organization) called XCEL HR www.xcelhr.com &lt;http://www.xcelhr.com&gt;.  They specialize in outsourced HR (payroll, benefits etc.).  My contact there is Patricia Driscoll 800-776-0076 Patricia.Driscoll@Xcelhr.com &lt;mailto:Patricia.Driscoll@Xcelhr.com&gt;. I would like to thank you for reaching out to us and again personally apologize for the trouble and inconvenience you experienced when attempting to make your initial connection with MBO Partners. I will be researching the events that led to your experience in order to improve our processes in the future. Your feedback is extremely important to us and I appreciate you sharing it. Sincerely,Sara___________________________________ SARA CONDEManager, Consultant Services MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!
