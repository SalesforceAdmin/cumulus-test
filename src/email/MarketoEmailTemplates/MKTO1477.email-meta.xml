Subject: Enrolled...finally  Hi, Sara.

I completed my enrollment form (except the system wouldn&apos;t allow me to correct my address).  

Pls review it and contact me with any questions.  You can email or call me on M/ 917-763-6361.

If all is in order, pls contact Sebastian von Stauffenberg, CEO of MicroRate, and copy his budget/finance mgr, Katherine, at the following addresses:
Sebastian@MicroRate.com &lt;mailto:Sebastian@MicroRate.com&gt;
Katherine@MicroRate.com &lt;mailto:Katherine@MicroRate.com&gt;

Their phone no is 703-243-5340.

I am meeting with them tomorrow.  No worries I&apos;d you can&apos;t, but if toy van send your client orientation package to them today, that would be great.

Thanks!

Joan
