My name is Nicolette Taylor and I am an Enrollment Specialist with MBO.  I received the email you sent to Lara and as she is currently out of the office I would be happy to assist you in bringing on as an Associate for the contract you  are considering with Deloitte.  I have included below a link to my calendar so you can select a convenient time for us to speak to go over the details of this new project and to discuss next steps.

I look forward to speaking with you.
 
Have a great day,
Nicolette

Lara,
 
I hope all is well and that you are enjoying the nice fall weather.  I would like to get in contact to see if you would be able to take me on as a client as I am considering a 6 month consultant contract with Deloitte.
 
Thank you very much,
Mark Bamberger

Hi Mark,
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you today!  To review Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) has engaged MBOs service to provide its independent contractors with the back-office support, tax advantages, and benefits of a W-2 employer -- without limiting your career independence and without the legal hassle of incorporating. Once you begin working as a contractor, we&apos;ll set up your contract with BAH and engage you as a W-2 employee. Then, as you work, we&apos;ll bill BAH (and any other clients you wish to use our services), collect your billings, withhold taxes, give access to excellent group benefits, and reimburse your business expenses. We even cover you under our General and Professional Liability insurance at no cost to you. And using MBO couldn&apos;t be easier: all you&apos;ll have to do is submit your time and expenses through your personal online MBO &quot;Business Center&quot; as you work, BAH will then approve them, and we will pay you. 
Ill contact you once we receive your Purchase Order from BAH and well review how to enter your time and expenses online through your Business Center. I have attached more detailed information on MBO Partners, including how MBO caters to new independent consultants (making your transition into the consulting world seamless) along with a list of expenses you can now claim as a contractor in order to receive the tax-benefit at time of payroll.  For more detailed information on our true group benefits offered through Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, please visit http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-exec-group-benefits 
I attached 3 net cash estimates.  The rates are $90, $93 and $120 per hour. You can see what the Gross Pay will look like annualized.  Keep in mind this is including no expenses or 401k. I included the 4% BAH fee, so you can see that line item as well. The $93/hour allows you to reach a gross of around $160k/year. 
I will send a follow up email with a link to begin enrollment and start using our services. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I will just wait to hear from you on the next steps. 
 
Thanks!
