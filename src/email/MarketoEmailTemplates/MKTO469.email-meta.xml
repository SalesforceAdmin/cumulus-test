Hi Steven:
 
WOW!!  What a surprise to hear from you!  How have you been?  To answer your question, I am currently working as a W-2 employee for a great company and as a matter of fact, I am now living and working in the Philippines!
 
When I come back to the states, maybe we can go out for a cup of coffee and chat a bit.  I would love to see you again and catch up on some old times!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Robert Becker

Dear Robert,
Its been some time since we last spoke with you, but I personally wanted to check in and share some news with you. We recently launched a new consultant-focused Web site which includes relevant tools such as a Bill Rate Calculator, a self-assessment tool on independence, and a video that shows how we help independents succeed in todays project economy. We encourage you to take a look.
Whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.
Please feel free to reply to this email and provide an update on how your contract search is going. Are you working on a project now or you currently working W2 at the moment?
Steven Arhancet
