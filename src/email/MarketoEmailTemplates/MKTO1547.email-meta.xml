    <subject>MBO Partners Webinar: Is Independence Right For You in 2012?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=potential independent consultant}},

Along the way, you shared with us that you have considered independent consulting as a career path. We appreciate your interest in our company and the topic of independence. It&apos;s a subject we are passionate about.

Each year, we observe a surge in interest around the topic just after the holidays from connections new and old. You may be interested in participating in our pre-New-Years Webinar:

Title: Is Independent Consulting Right For You?

Date/Time: Tomorrow, 12/30, at 12:30 PM EST

Or just reading about our point of view in a recent posting we did.

Steve
