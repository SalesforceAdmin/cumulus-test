Subject: I forgot -- quick question
 
Steve,
 
In terms of client management...
- what did we we talk about, when, what&apos;s next, etc.
 
As soon as you secure your first engagement, you would simply introduce me to the point of contact at the client to complete the paperwork once you’ve negotiated the compensation 
 
 
Do you have a recommendation of software?
 
You can use the MBO system to do everything; no need to purchase any software.
 
Is that all handled by the MBO dashboard/interface?
 
If so, what happens if someone leaves -- can they export their client data to something transportable??
 
Yes, you can export to different file formats at anytime.
 
Russell
