The topic of the webinar is “How to Calculate Your Consulting Rate: Making the Transition from W-2 to 1099.”  How the Webinar works: ·         For the first 30 minutes I will walk the audience through the most common method of bill rate calculation: the cost-based method·         For the remaining 30 minutes, we’d like to share firsthand stories from current associates about the process they used to arrive at their bill rate. During this second portion, we’ll call on our panelists to share stories and reactions, including you! What would I be committing to?·         If you are willing to contribute, we will schedule an initial call to go over the logistics, which should last about 30 minutes·         The webinar itself will take an hour, but you are welcome to join at the half-hour mark if you have other commitments that day, leading to a total commitment of about 1-1.5 hours Read more about the webinar  &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/Calculating-Bill-Rates.html&quot;&gt;here. We hope you will consider joining an important discussion and positioning yourself as a seasoned professional in  your community.  I look forward to hearing from you and would be happy to connect you with my colleague Jaime Buckley who can help answer any additional logistics or content questions for you leading up to the day of the Webinar itself.  Regards, Steve___________________________________Steve ArhancetDirector, Consultant ServicesMBO Partners t: 703.793.6011f: 703.793.6081m: 540.560.8837e: sarhancet@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
