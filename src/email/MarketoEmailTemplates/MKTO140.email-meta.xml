Steve,

I sent an e-mail a few days ago. Did you receive it? It gave some information pertinent to the cash flow prediction sheet and also contained a few questions I had thought up over the weekend.

Also, How&apos;d you do?

Kevin,
 
I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation a few weeks ago.  I just got back from vacation this week – if there are any questions you have feel free to email or call me.
