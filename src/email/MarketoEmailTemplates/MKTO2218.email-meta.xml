    <subject>4 Rules to Re-Energize Your Career in 2013</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Consultant}},
 
 On Jan 10th at 1pm ET, we will hold a webinar entitled &quot;Disrupt Yourself: Four Rules for Reinventing Your Career in 2013 &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/Jan10WebDisrupt-Yourself.html&gt;.&quot;

In this not-to-be-missed New Year Careers Webinar, Whitney Johnson, author of the new book Dare, Dream, Do &lt;http://www.amazon.com/Dare-Dream-Do-Remarkable-Things/dp/1937134121&gt;, builds on her Harvard Business Review article Disrupt YourselfÂ®, which applies the road-tested theory of disruptive innovation to the expert professional seeking to start or further succeed in independent professional consulting work. 
An engaging and well-respected speaker, Johnson shows how breaking out of the status quo can help consultants of any experience level excel in their career path. In addition, she provides practical tips along with real-world examples of personal disruption, with a focus on the independent worker.
During this free, hour-long webinar you will learn the 4 rules of disruption:


 - Target a need that can be met more effectively
 - Identify your disruptive strengths
 - Step back (or sideways) in order to grow
 - Let your strategy emerge
