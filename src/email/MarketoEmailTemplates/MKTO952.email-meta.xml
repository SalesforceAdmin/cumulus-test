Hi Sara,

The attachment did come through, yes.  Helpful and you provide a good sense of the site.

Also, I am honored to be among the first to see your film debut  :)

Best,

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Hi Colby,
 
Please let me know if you receive the attachment. Outlook is giving me issues and I am hoping it will work this time. If not, I will have to get some software to compress the file.

Thanks,
Sara

Hi Colby,
 
I was able to convenience my marketing team to allow me to send you our first rough daft edit (they are still mastering the final.) The audio is poor and the mouse click is loud but it should give you a genral picture. I just ask that you do not distribute this as it is not a finished product.
 
Thank you!
Sara
