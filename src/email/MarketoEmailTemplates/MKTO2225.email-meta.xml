We received your contact information from {{lead.How Heard Additional Data:default=your friend}}, a current member of MBO Partners who believes you could greatly benefit from our program. My name is {{lead.EM FName:default=Sara}} {{lead.EM LName:default=Conde}}, a Consultant Services Advisor, and I invite you to learn what MBO Partners is all about &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program/why-mbo?r={{lead.How Heard Additional Data:Default=}}&amp;re={{lead.First Name}}&gt;, and decide for yourself.

For more than 25 years, our company has led the independent consulting sector in America. Our mission is simple –we make it easy for independent consultants and their clients to work together by handling the administrative, financial, legal, tax and expense burdens that bog down consultants, thus increasing their billable time. In addition, we provide them access to the largest exclusive online community of successful independent consultants, the clients that engage with them, and a multitude of valuable resources.
