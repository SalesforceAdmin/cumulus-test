I can still speak with you tomorrow as I have some knowledge of the Booz Allen account, and if a project comes through for Booz Allen first I will just transfer you to an enrollment manager that works with that account at that time.
 
Thank you for your response and I look forward to speaking with you!
 
Have a great evening,
Nicolette

Hi Nocolette.  Both I think - eventually, but probably starting with Booz Allen.  Am working with some potential clients now.  If you need to shift me to a Booz Allen specialist that&apos;s OK with me if OK with.  Just let me know if I need to schedule with someone else.
 
Thanks,  Frank...

Hi Frank,
 
Thank you for scheduling a time to speak with me tomorrow.  I noticed in your inquiry that you mentioned you heard about MBO Partners through your colleagues at Booz Allen Hamilton, are you planning on working for Booz Allen on a contract basis once you leave full time employment there, or do you plan on working with other clients and you just heard about our services and wanted to know more?
 
If you are going to be working with Booz Allen as a consultant I will need to put you in touch with an account manager that works on the Booz Allen account as they will be able to provide you with the specifics of that particular account.
 
Thank you again for your interest in MBO Partners and I look forward to hearing from you soon!
 
Have a great day,
Nicolette
