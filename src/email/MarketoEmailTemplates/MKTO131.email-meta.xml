Here is the information on how to enter expenses into the system.  I noticed you have not yet entered any expenses, so I will hold those funds in your business center until you enter expenses to offeset your tax burden.
 
Expenses:
Click on “expenses” located at the top of the screenClick on “add a new expense”Select the appropriate expense type from the list on the rightEnter in the required details (all fields marked with an asterisk)Upload receipt if necessary Click “save”; if the expense appears in Green you’re all set, if it appears in Orange you need to upload a receipt and if it appears in Black then you are missing information and you need to re-checkIf you prefer not to upload your receipt click on the tab labeled “Expense Report.”  This will create a cover sheet for your expenses 
Along with the cover sheet please fax (703-793-6070) or email (doc@mbopartners.com) all receipts to MBO. If you email please copy me as 
well.
 
Again, I would like to welcome you to MBO.  If you would like a brief tour of your account with us, I would be more than happy to do so and we can answer any questions that you may have along the way.  Simply let me know of a good time to speak and I will reach out.
I look forward to working with you!
 
Regards,
 
Steve
