Thank you for requesting more information after my  Becoming the Boss of You webinar on Thursday. We created this resource guide &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO-Partners-Additional Resources.pdf&gt; that includes more information on MBO Partners and additional  in-depth educational resources covering the topics that I discussed yesterday. 
We have also added you to our Independent Consulting Brief (monthly newsletter packed with education, tips and resources) and Independent Consultant Webinar Series email lists.

If you have any questions, or would simply like to learn more about how MBO can help you along your journey to becoming self-employed, please contact Sara Conde, a Consultant Services Advisor at MBO. You can email her at sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;, or simply call her at 703-793-6028.

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you!
