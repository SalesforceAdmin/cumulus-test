Nicolette, thank you!  You were most helpful. I&apos;ll digest the information you&apos;ve shared and get back with you as appropriate.  I expect further insight into consulting tasks by early January, so you might anticipate a call to enroll sometime in the next 30 days.  
 
Have a Merry Christmas!
 
Mark
