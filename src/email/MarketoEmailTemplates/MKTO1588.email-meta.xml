Once this template page, with standard copy/language is created, we can send to you for your edits to customize for your consultants. ·         We can provide BTG a commission on each referral that is sent to MBO as a result of marketing our services to your audience.  Some items we discussed BTG can do for MBO·         If you provide us with a handful of reqs we can post these in our MBO Access community to be visible by our members. We’ll do the legwork and get them setup in the system, you would just need to send over the details via email. ·         As Gene mentioned, should BTG be interested in learning more about our services for companies like BTG (to help reduce risk and manage the manner in which you pay your independent contractors), I can be your main point of contact to move forward on next steps to learn more.  ·         Advertising the MBO Service offering to your members/audience.  We can assist by providing language for any newsletters, webinars or other communications you choose to advertise our services through.  If you are interested in taking this to the next step, we can setup a call to discuss these items.  I can also draft up a partnership document so these items are clearly outlined for each party. Look forward to working with you.  Regards, Steve ___________________________________Steve ArhancetDirector, Consultant ServicesMBO Partners t: 703.793.6011f: 703.793.6081m: 540.560.8837e: sarhancet@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sarhancet@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
