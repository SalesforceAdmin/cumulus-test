Subject: Re: Donald, MBO can answer your consulting questions Sara, Thank you for reaching out to me. I have been a consultant for the last 10 years and took a few years off to try another career path. At this point, I have decided to go back to consulting and MBO appeals to me due to the benefits offered and the payroll aspect. Can you please tell me what the medical/dental benefit programs are and the associated costs? Best regards, Don Steele  On Friday, November 22, 2013 10:21 AM, Sara Conde &lt;info@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:info@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Donald,Working independently means the freedom to make your own career decisions - and having a guide to help you along the way can make a big difference.In my experience, consultants that are committed to learning more every day tend to be successful.
