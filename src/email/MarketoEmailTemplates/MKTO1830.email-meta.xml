If you go to Expenses -&gt; Review Expenses you can see a full list of what has been approved, etc. Right now everything you have entered to date has been approved aside from the rail from July 2nd (we need a receipt for that one.) I only see to meal expenses that were entered: StatusDateTypeApproved AmountReimbursement StatusClient PaidAuthorized &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry?display=ExpenseStatusHistory&amp;id=109316_1666&gt;Jun 4, 2012 &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry&gt;Parking96.00Payment Pending : $96.00$0.00Authorized &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry?display=ExpenseStatusHistory&amp;id=109318_1728&gt;Jun 4, 2012 &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry&gt;Rail248.00Payment Pending : $248.00$0.00Authorized &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry?display=ExpenseStatusHistory&amp;id=109320_1728&gt;Jun 5, 2012 &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry&gt;Medical31.65Payment Pending : $31.65$0.00Authorized &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry?display=ExpenseStatusHistory&amp;id=109311_2613&gt;Jun 14, 2012 &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry&gt;Meals and Entertainment53.99Payment Pending : $53.99$0.00Authorized &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry?display=ExpenseStatusHistory&amp;id=109322_1728&gt;Jun 15, 2012 &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry&gt;Office Equipment513.59Payment Pending : $513.59$0.00Authorized &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry?display=ExpenseStatusHistory&amp;id=109313_2675&gt;Jun 21, 2012 &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry&gt;Meals and Entertainment46.11Payment Pending : $46.11$0.00Authorized &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry?display=ExpenseStatusHistory&amp;id=109306_4038&gt;Jun 27, 2012 &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry&gt;Medical25.00Payment Pending : $25.00$0.00Authorized &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry?display=ExpenseStatusHistory&amp;id=109308_5&gt;Jun 27, 2012 &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry&gt;Medical32.02Payment Pending : $32.02$0.00PendingJul 2, 2012 &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry?display=ExpenseUpdate&amp;eid=20120719235048784400000000&gt;Rail248.00Not Authorized$0.00Total$1,294.36 It is possible you entered them and did not save them?
