Yes, that is correct. We would get them set up with their own MBO account. We can even set it up so you are able to bill the client a higher rate than the negotiated rate with the consultant.  The consultant will only see the rate you negotiated with him/her in their business center account with MBO. I will go into more detail on this if/when the situation arises or  you can give me a ring if you want to dig deeper on this topic. 
 
Keep the good questions coming! J

Subject: Partner question
 
Sara,
 
Question of the day. We occasionally work with partners on engagements. We may be the sub, they may be the sub. In either case, I assume the contract with them for work to be done would flow through MBO. Is that correct? 
 
Tom
