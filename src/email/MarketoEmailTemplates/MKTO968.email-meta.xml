Hi Sharon,
 
My name is Sara Conde and I am Randall Thackers contact at MBO Partners. I wanted to follow up on the voicemail I left you and introduce myself. Russell runs all his billing through us and I understand you will be taking a 15% cut of his current project with NeighborWorks America. In in order to pay you we will need you to go through our vender registration which I will send to you in a separate email. 
 
If you are curious about MBO Partners and what we do and how we work, we have a short one page overview that may answer some of your questions, which you may access by going here.
I look forward to working with you,  
 
 
Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.

Take care,
Sara
