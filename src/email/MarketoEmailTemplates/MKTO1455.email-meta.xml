Subject: Follow-up Nicolette -- I believe we spoke a few months back. I would like to get information on your service, in particular, as a freelance marketing communications consultant, I&apos;m interested in both your process and associated fees as a MBO consultant and the related opportunity to secure health benefits through this association. I can be reached later today or early tomorrow morning (between 9 and 10) or early afternoon (between 1 and 3). My phone number is 202-744-0331. Thank you.
