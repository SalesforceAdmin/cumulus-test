Do you do anything with proposal work (management, writing, editing, capture support, etc.?) If so, I have a good firm I could refer you to (who also happens to pay our fee)…let me know. Also, check out our “Independence Guide” by going here. &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide&gt;  It has some good tips for finding your first project.  Best of luck finding your next contract! Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Shawndrell Lynch Hey Sara,

Still searching. Finding a good contract is harder than I thought. I&apos;m working with a couple of recruiters now, but nothing has materialized yet.

Thanks,
