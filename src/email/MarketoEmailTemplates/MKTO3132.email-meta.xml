We really like Red Tomatoes if you ever go to Berekeley or Oakland, but we’ve heard good things about Pete Davis as well. You’ll see both listed on our notary directory here: http://www.mbopartners.com/notaries &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/notaries&gt;. If these aren’t close to you, let me know and I’ll see what I can do about checking into someone else.  Thanks,Emily ___________________________________Emily StringerConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6282f: 703.793.6457e: estringer@mbopartners.com &lt;estringer@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Date: Fri, 3 Jan 2014 22:21:57 +0000Hi Michael,  I double checked with my team, and we are not having Lamont sign our I-9 forms. For everyone under FastRobot and OOF, we’re sending them to local Notaries. If you’ll let me know where you’re located, I’m more than happy to send you the listings for some I-9 trained notaries in your area. Thanks!Emily ___________________________________Emily StringerConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6282f: 703.793.6457e: estringer@mbopartners.com &lt;http://estringer@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: spoke with Lamont and John Sounds great, Michael! I’m going to send over your enrollment link on just a moment. Just so we’re clear, here are the things that we still need to do: 1)      Complete your enrollment2)      Complete your I-9 form (hold off on that – I believe Lamont should be able to sign that, but don’t quote me.)3)      MBO Access enrollment – this takes about three minutes to complete4)      Receive a contract from OOF for you. Lamont will handle that.  Let me know if you have any questions on this, and I’ll circle back with you on the I-9 form later this morning. Thank you,Emily ___________________________________Emily StringerConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6282f: 703.793.6457e: estringer@mbopartners.com &lt;http://estringer@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
