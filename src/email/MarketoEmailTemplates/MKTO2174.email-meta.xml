I would love to discuss this with you, please schedule a time to speak with me at your convenience via my online calender by going here &lt;https://my.timedriver.com/8SLYS&gt;.  I look forward to connecting with you! Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
