Dear Christopher,
We had a conversation some time ago regarding our services.  As a courtesy I wanted to follow up and get an update from you.
We also are now publishing an Independent Consulting Brief.  It&apos;s a monthly email that provides access to a convenient list of relevant resources, tools and best practices.  You can sign up for it by going to http://www.mbopartners.com/independent-consulting-brief &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independent-consulting-brief&gt;.  Feel free to provide an update by simply replying to this email.
Regards,
