I just tried to give you a call but when your voicemail came on it said your mailbox was not set up so I was unable to leave a message.  Please give me a call when you have a moment and would like to speak.
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Steve:
I am still considering working with MBO.
I&apos;m focusing on sales now.
Please send me the hourly rate calculator you showed in the video.
Thanks.

Juan,
 
I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners and how that would work on your next consulting contract.  I wanted to touch base and find out how that was going.
 
Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
 
This interactive tool shows the value of using a company like MBO as an alternative to incorporation: http://www.mbopartners.com/#whoweareYou can browse through the group benefits you would have access to here: http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-exec-group-benefits
There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract:http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-webcast-index
 
As I mentioned once you find your next contract we can do a financial illustration showing what that income would look like being run through MBO Partners. Best of luck finding your next contract and I’ll follow up with you as promised.
 
If you have questions before then, feel free to schedule a convenient time for you on my online schedule: https://my.timedriver.com/C9CPC.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
