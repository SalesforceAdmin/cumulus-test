Hi Anshuman,
 
Thanks so much for letting me know, I really appreciate the feedback and will pass it along. The 5% does cover more than just invoicing and billing (for example, professional insurances, tax administration, expense deduction management, contract negotiations, etc.) but I understand that you have already done a lot of the leg work on getting your own company set up and you dont really have a need for these services at this time. 
 
Please keep us in mind if anything changes and good luck on your project!
 
Take care,
Sara

Thanks Sara for all the information and this follow up. My client is not interested in splitting the cost and 5% is way too much for me just to have the timesheet/invoicing done through MBO. 
 
If things change, I&apos;ll get in touch with you again.
 
Thanks,
Anshuman
