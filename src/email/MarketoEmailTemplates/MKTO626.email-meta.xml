You are very welcome, I hope you had a great holiday season!  
 
Booz Allen does have an existing agreement with MBO so it would be easy to get you set up with them if you decide to work with them as an IC.  
 
I would be happy to set up another time to speak with you and your wife, and I have included a link to my calendar below for you to set up a convenient time:

I look forward to speaking with you, have a great weekend!
 
Nicolette

Nicolette:
 
Thanks for following up.  My plan is to leave Booz Allen at the end of March, and be available to them (and others) in April.  They have already told me they would like to have an MBO agreement with me so that I could provide support as an IC.
 
I would very much like to go over the details of MBO Partners with you again, and at a time my wife/&quot;business manager&quot; can listen in.  What&apos;s the best way to do that?
 
John

Hello John,

I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?

Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one:

MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, theres real hard facts about The State of Independence in America that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent. 
Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Nicolette
