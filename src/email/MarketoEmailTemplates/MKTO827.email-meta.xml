This is great!. I like how you broke down the options by A and B and then attached the details to the fee schedule. I think it is much more approachable and easier to understand.
 
Let me know how it turns out!

Russell – Please see below response to questions from the Director of Property Management and let me know if you have any questions!
 
Please describe any outstanding program concerns (incl. hauler, house keeping and tenant issues).-we can always recycle more and we just need to understand how to encourage our clients.Please describe/supply previously-provided tenant education regarding recycling participation and/or municipal requirements.  We had the DC recycling inspector come in to look at each Client’s plan about 2 years ago and they walked their space.  They also came out and did a presentation (this same guy).  We also did another single stream educational meeting about a year ago.When did program, house keeping or hauling service last change significantly?  About a year ago with single stream (april 2011)What may tenants recycle beyond bottles/cans/paper?  (e.g. fluorescent lamps?  computers?) Batteries, cardboard, ewaste, plastic, cell phones, and we try to help give away unwanted furniturePlease describe role of trash/hauling company in their support of your program(s).  ZERO – they’re terrible and that’s why we are hoping to change soon.Please describe any recent concerns with DPW enforcement (violations are $200, $600, $1500).  There hasn’t been a problem in a while.
