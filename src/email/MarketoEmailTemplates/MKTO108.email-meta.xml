My name is Nicolette and I am part of the Direct Enrollment team with MBO.  I received the inquiry you placed in our system and wanted to follow up with you and set up a time for us to speak early next week.  I know you mentioned you were only available during the week before 10am so would early next week sometime between 9-9:30 work for you (our business hours are 9-5:30)?  Please let me know your availability and I would be happy to reach out to you.
 
I look forward to speaking with you!
 
Have a great weekend,
 
Nicolette
