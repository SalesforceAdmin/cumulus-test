Subject: RE: MBO Partners / Brooke Crouter Sara:Ive been debating whether or not I am ready to take the leap to MBO partners, but first I need to explore some of my questions.  For example:1)      Do you hold clearances for your associates? Yes, please see this link &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Security_Clearance_Info_Sheet_Generic.pdf&gt;. 2)      Can you provide a list of firms with whom you have established contracts so I know if my potential clients are covered? Many of our clients are listed here &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Introduction.pdf&gt;, if you are looking a specific firm just shoot me an email with their name and I can look them up in our system to see if we have an agreement with them. 3)      Can you be an MBO partner and also associated with another firm that provides staffing services? Many 1099s work for multiple firms  do you allow that? Yes, we have MANY staffing companies as clients. JI am sure I have many more questions, but I have not yet catalogued them all.   Could you find some time next week for a phone call to go over some of these questions?  Right now, I have some flexibility on scheduling on Wed/Thurs/Fri next week. Thanks Brooke Crouter301-580-3839   From: Sara Conde [mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;]
