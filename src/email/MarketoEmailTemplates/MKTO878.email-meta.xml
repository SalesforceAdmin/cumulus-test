Some time ago you requested information regarding the services offered by MBO Partners and when I reached out you said that it was not a good time but in the new year you would like me to reach out again.  Now might not be the right time for you, but whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.
 
We also have a number of consultant resources that we continually update that you may find helpful.   You may find them here: http://www.mbopartners.com/resources. 
 
If you are interested in hearing more about the MBO program please schedule a time to speak on my calendar link below and I will reach out then.
 
I look forward to speaking with you soon!
 
Regards,
 
Nicolette
