I am so sorry to hear that, I am sure it’s very disappointing but that’s just the way it goes sometimes. I had that happen to another contractor last month – so you are not the only one.   What we will do is we will keep the account open until the payment for the outstanding hours has gone through after that we will close the account. You will still have access to the account when it is closed and if you ever want to come back on with us or take us to another client re-enrollment is quick and easy. Best of luck finding your next project (and hopefully running it through MBO!) Have you entered all your hours that you have to bill? If so I will release the invoices early so you can at least get paid as quickly as possible for the work you have already done. Let me know - thanks! Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Fw: CTS, etc Sara,    Looks like just after we got everything setup, I would like to close this down.  It turns out the work that Serco brought me on for fell through, so my services will no longer be required beyond the hours I have already entered.  Please advise how to do this.  There may be some other opportunities coming up though in the future.  Thanks. Justin StonerRCDD, RTPM(i), VCP4, CAPMP.O.

Subject: RE: CTS, etc Justin,Sorry, thought I responded to this.Ran it past the CTS team and with the reduction of the Sample Task, including no Datacenter..etc., go ahead and close out. Think this was a good exercise, and I will keep you in mind for future endeavors. Thanks, Jim James M. Quinn

Subject: CTS, etc Jim,    Are you going to need me anymore since CTS has been toned down?  If not, I&apos;m probably going to close this bill out unless there&apos;s something else you think you need me to consult on.  Thanks. Justin StonerRCDD, RTPM(i), VCP4, CAPMP.O.
