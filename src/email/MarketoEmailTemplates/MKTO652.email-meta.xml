You can always use MBO Partners to consult to any clients whom you choose to run through our program.  You can review some information about how all of that works by visiting my information page here: http://info.mbopartners.com/advisor-info-s-arhancet.html. 
 
The next step would be to enroll in our system to get your account ready.  The second step would be to introduce us to your client once you have secured a project (verbally).  We would then take care of all the paperwork.  
 
You will unfortunately need to chat with me on the phone before enrolling in our system so we can work through a financial illustration showing you what your income would look like being run through MBO.  You can schedule a time that works for you using my online schedule by going here: https://my.timedriver.com/C9CPC
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Steve,
 
I am interested in researching the opportunities offered by MBO partners. I had originally reach out to your company back about 6 months ago but was told by one of the Government personnel people that I would not be able to move. That person has since retired and I plan on revisiting my options.  I will be traveling to APG on Tuesday and plan to discuss with my Government POC. I would prefer to keep all communications on my personnel email and will only be available after work hours to discuss.
 
Please let me know what the next step is to proceed.
 
 
Regards,
 
Ed Shinn

Dear Edward,

Along the way, you shared with us that you have considered independent consulting as a career path. We appreciate your interest in our company and the topic of independence. It&apos;s a subject we are passionate about.

Each year, we observe a surge in interest around the topic just after the holidays from connections new and old. You may be interested in participating in our pre-New-Years Webinar:

Title: Is Independent Consulting Right For You?

Date/Time: Tomorrow, 12/30, at 12:30 PM EST

Or just reading about our point of view in a recent posting we did.

Steve
