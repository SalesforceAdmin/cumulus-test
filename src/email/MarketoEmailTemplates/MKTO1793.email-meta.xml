Just wanted to give you a heads up. Any details on the payment would be helpful i.e. check number etc.  I have also attached wire and ACH info if they want to make payment electronically (which is preferred as it is easier for us to track and turns around much faster than checks.)  ACH has no fee, while a wire usually does – just letting you know in case they come back and say it will cost them money to pay electronically. 
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
