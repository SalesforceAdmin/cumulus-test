The last step is sending me a copy of your completed I-9.  You can find the I-9 form in your enrollment documents; you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.)   Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
