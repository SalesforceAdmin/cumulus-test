    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Consultant}},
 
 On June 28th at 1pm ET, we will hold a webinar entitled &quot;LinkedIn for Independent Consultants: 5 Steps to Enhance Your Profile &amp; Bring in More Clients.&quot;


Whether you are new to the social networking world, or a seasoned professional, it is important for all independent consultants and micro-consulting practices to take pause in their busy schedules to revisit (or create) an online profile on LinkedIn.

This is why we&apos;ve invited LinkedIn expert, Melissa Washington &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/June12Web-LinkedIn-Independent-Consultants.html&gt;, who typically charges over $90 per training session, to educate independent consultants and answer your questions about how to best use the LinkedIn network to find new clients.

During this free, hour-long webinar you will learn how to...


 - Compose a strong profile headline
 - Connect to the right people
 - Communicate your expertise
 - Build the right group and company presence
 - Gain more clients



Register today &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/June12Web-LinkedIn-Independent-Consultants.html&gt; to gain new clients tomorrow!
