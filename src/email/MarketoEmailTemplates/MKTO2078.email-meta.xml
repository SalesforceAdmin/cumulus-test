So please just let me know cost when you are done ordering (you can forward me the email confirmation) and I ensure we ledger that amount back into your MBO account. Thanks for your patience as I figured this out! Sara___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; If you are in the DC area please check out our upcoming networking event! &lt;http://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/event?oeidk=a07e6cqaqtk0702919f&amp;llr=kp5x6qkab&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: Your MBO account is now active Sara, How do I order business cards? I haven&apos;t seen a link on the website, and I think it would be best if I had some with the MBO Partners logo on them.  MattOn Wed, Sep 26, 2012 at 8:00 AM, &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:
