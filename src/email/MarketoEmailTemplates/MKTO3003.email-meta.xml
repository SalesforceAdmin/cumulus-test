Because the work is that of a professional consulting nature (“behind the desk” type work) there should be no issue with our liability coverage. The next step is to schedule a call. To cut down on phone tag I recommend booking a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here &lt;https://my.timedriver.com/8SLYS&gt;.  You can  watch a short video about who we are on You Tube &lt;http://youtu.be/zKDzwSTmGv4&gt;. You can learn more about how MBO works by clicking here &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/how-mbo-works&gt;. I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners! Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject: RE: MBO Partners  Consulting will be for Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) who support a Federal agency (Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration) during regulatory processes involving proposed Natural Gas Liquefaction (LNG) installations.  In spite of the names, the primary hazards I will encounter are those in an office setting – either in Washington DC where I am going tomorrow or in my home (from which I expect to do most of my consulting work (paper cuts the most obvious hazard).  Put another way, I consult with Federal entities on regulatory issues. Agreed-on 1099 rate is $125 per hour. The only remaining workday that I will be in Houston for the rest of the year is Monday, 16 Dec.  After that, my wife and I will spend two weeks in San Francisco with Lamont and his family.  At any convenient time you could contact me via my cell-phone (713/320-2015) if there is anything else you need to know. From: Sara Conde [mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;]

Subject: MBO Partners  Hi Lamont and Roy, Lamont – thank you so much for the referral, we truly appreciate it. If working with MBO makes sense for Roy I will make sure this referral counts towards our official referral program (since it is outside Fast Robot) so we can compensate you accordingly if and when Roy’s enrollment becomes eligible. The way the program works now, you would receive $500 once we receive 30k in billings from Roy and Roy’s first 5k in billings would be free of charge.  Roy – it’s so nice to meet you via email. MBO can meet (and actually far exceed) these insurance requirements (you can view our certificate of insurance here &lt;http://link.mbopartners.com/ol/0xEFfZmddHNcoUZ1%5Fu%2DNb%5Fmgz3iQN8jlq65yDbq2lMIt3kF6L7yJPEjr1YIDT8Z0dufDUUQVGpQ8zA1VFe6BXIZB6eFPBEO9THX8j6yceoRKLOQ12dl17an49VQk%2DtuqvEX1W0MFcEVvfCilcasZszH0MacSBjqN32zsArUpsTIPkZAw%5FJ%2DFTuPk1ler7Gjy52ejEGRpyeWYvmWID8lTr%2DZTkRMJ%5F3wSfvjY2y3KwbF8vRYD2%2DZ130lkzMlQNPBluQSwZg6z5oLOVut3F7%2DwwrOqv64fZh892qsfcDbWHHyVFo6%5FLC5y%5Fz6Ly3N%2Ddw%2C%2C/1gwVMM7QNFhXs0g45v6WMqj%5FizvFaIvmuLNwRuX1ncI81gd3f%2D3IPVKgpfF%2DI6Izd%5F2QBBADLKNgzRxUH9%2D2U6kO6vFbVEy5TATrj6qHPZV7UJ9J1uJlroqQzWsJo8THwHrdMGIMEzQ%2DQg25b48ikDz1JLwGZzrSqFbUHrEWjzEhsJot156eevbn3zbz0Q%2C%2C&gt;) but I need understand exactly what type of work you will be doing to ensure it falls under our liability policy as we have some tricky rules about engineering. Could you provide me with a detailed description of the work to be performed and the 1099 rate they are offering you so I can ensure MBO can cover it? If we are good to go on that front, then we can schedule a call and get things moving along.  Thank so much!Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;http://link.mbopartners.com/ol/0xEFfZmddHNcoUZ1%5Fu%2DNb%5Fmgz3iQN8jlq65yDbq2lMIt3kF6L7yJPEjr1YIDT8Z0dufDUUQVGpQ8zA1VFe6BXIZB6eFPBEO9THX8j6yceoRKLOQ12dl17an49VQk%2DtuqvEX1W0MFcEVvfCilcasZszH0MacSBjqN32zsArUpsTIPkZAw%5FJ%2DFTuPk1ler7Gjy52ejEGRpyeWYvmWID8lTr%2DZTkRMJ%5F3wSfvjY2y3KwbF8vRYD2%2DZ130lkzMlQNPBluQSwZg6z5oLOVut3F7%2DwwrOqv64fZh892qsfcDbWHHyVFo6%5FLC5y%5Fz6Ly3N%2Ddw%2C%2C/0xkILICQIUJaukly7tyUIKb9nifUdJ26qPJ%2DBvq538Qq5lxxebGdIHTOo%2DlbP5ZjR9yLCg4ZCtUz5h1hN%2DLGOdJm8dFbO0OmWSnrrITiVtgcXKFY6vRy5oGQ%5F0kEpuiF1w%5FoTBwq&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://link.mbopartners.com/ol/0xEFfZmddHNcoUZ1%5Fu%2DNb%5Fmgz3iQN8jlq65yDbq2lMIt3kF6L7yJPEjr1YIDT8Z0dufDUUQVGpQ8zA1VFe6BXIZB6eFPBEO9THX8j6yceoRKLOQ12dl17an49VQk%2DtuqvEX1W0MFcEVvfCilcasZszH0MacSBjqN32zsArUpsTIPkZAw%5FJ%2DFTuPk1ler7Gjy52ejEGRpyeWYvmWID8lTr%2DZTkRMJ%5F3wSfvjY2y3KwbF8vRYD2%2DZ130lkzMlQNPBluQSwZg6z5oLOVut3F7%2DwwrOqv64fZh892qsfcDbWHHyVFo6%5FLC5y%5Fz6Ly3N%2Ddw%2C%2C/1gwVMM7QNEZOogl76fOJI7v5kTDSadartLEyVvrtxvAq1kMjIPT6GWrVgvBVTbAHcOKSCBtVQbZw%2DSFaSaXHWotk%5FMVfH0CgTBfauJiPPaBbWoJGz9hIyo%2DM2WwwrZjRthmfLQ%2C%2C&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://link.mbopartners.com/ol/0xEFfZmddHNcoUZ1%5Fu%2DNb%5Fmgz3iQN8jlq65yDbq2lMIt3kF6L7yJPEjr1YIDT8Z0dufDUUQVGpQ8zA1VFe6BXIZB6eFPBEO9THX8j6yceoRKLOQ12dl17an49VQk%2DtuqvEX1W0MFcEVvfCilcasZszH0MacSBjqN32zsArUpsTIPkZAw%5FJ%2DFTuPk1ler7Gjy52ejEGRpyeWYvmWID8lTr%2DZTkRMJ%5F3wSfvjY2y3KwbF8vRYD2%2DZ130lkzMlQNPBluQSwZg6z5oLOVut3F7%2DwwrOqv64fZh892qsfcDbWHHyVFo6%5FLC5y%5Fz6Ly3N%2Ddw%2C%2C/1gwVMM7QNENcs0Jk%2Df2VbKTvkCXBaIymvq5uR%5FTp34As3E57YP7ONAz%5FmtxWDpM%5FOvvDAg0eF5UnzQdMJfSad90S4sB8IHu4ez%2DuopTPZIFHaPEh%2DtBY0qr2nTIjofmEol7YCF0abFRUXVPPRKoLsgj0KbkWeCqG9k7GcNQH2Xss&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject:  Hello Sara, My father, Roy Lucas, has recently retired as a chemical/process engineer but will be doing some contract work for a third party in the coming year. As I have had nothing but positive experiences with MBO for the last 5 years, I recommended he pass the contract through you to simplify his taxes and take advantage of the liability insurance and protection you offer. This has nothing to do with FastRobot&apos;s relationship with MBO, I&apos;m just providing an introduction. I&apos;ve CC&apos;d him, and he should be able to provide more information, but I&apos;ve included the insurance requirements the company wished him to sign for any 1099 work. I&apos;d like to make sure that the MBO provided insurance would cover their requirements or that you can steer him towards whatever supplemental insurance he&apos;d need. 6.2     Consultant shall provide and maintain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement: (a)   Workers&apos; compensation insurance in such jurisdiction in which the work is to be performed with limits required by law of an employer, and employers&apos; liability insurance with minimum limits of $100,000. (b)  Comprehensive General Liability and Automobile insurance protecting Consultant and Company against liability from damages because of injuries, including death, suffered by persons other than employees of Consultant and liability for damages to property arising from and growing out of any operation of Consultant (including the operation of automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles owned or non-owned) in connection with the performance of this Agreement.  Comprehensive General Liability and Automobile Liability insurance limits shall be not less than the following: (1)     Comprehensive General Liability Insurance: Personal Injury                           $500,000 per occurrenceProperty Damage                         $100,000 per occurrence (2)     Automobile (owned and non-owned) Liability Insurance: Personal Injury                           $200,000 per personPersonal Injury                           $500,000 per occurrenceProperty Damage                         $100,000 per occurrence Consultant further understands and agrees that if Consultant is required to travel at Company&apos;s request, rental car company Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) and Liability Insurance Supplement (LIS) are not reimbursable by Company and such coverages, if purchased, shall be paid for by Consultant.  In the absence of the required insurance coverage stated above, Consultant must sign below.</textOnly>
