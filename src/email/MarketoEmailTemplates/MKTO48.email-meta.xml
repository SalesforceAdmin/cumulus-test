This is great news.  I will take care of the W9.  You’ll want to get your Business Center all set-up with MBO, which you have completed the online portion.  The only part that I need back is the I9 Form.  You’ll find that on page 13 of this packet.  There is an example on the page before on how it should be completed. You’ll need to have a notary sign in section 2 and you sign in second 1.  Since you are using a passport, you’ll need to include a clear copy of that photo ID when you fax this back in.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Steve,
 
It&apos;s a go for my first contract.  Per your request, I will copy you in with the engagement manager, Marla Ravkind at General Datatech.  The bill rate is $125/hour.  Travel expenses and international communication expenses are to be reimbursed.  For this project, the client is booking the flight and hotel.
 
They asked me to fill out a W9.  Is this appropriate?
 
 
Thanks,
 
Bill Ferguson
