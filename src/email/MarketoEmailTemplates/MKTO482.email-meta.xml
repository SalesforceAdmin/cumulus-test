Youre welcome and well definitely be around if the situation makes sense to revisit us.  We will have some upcoming webinars in the next few months with some really top notch speakers  well be sure to send you an email with a full list of all webinars for the year. 
 
Lastly, thank you for the compliment  we have definitely been growing like crazy.  Weve nearly quadrupled in size in the past few years!
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Thanks, Steve.
 
I have a full consulting client base right now and have two accountants on staff as well.  I think I am set for the time being.  I have made a note to myself to re-visit this in Q1.
 
Looks like you have made good progress, and I appreciate you keeping me updated.
 
Best regards,
 
-Lisa
