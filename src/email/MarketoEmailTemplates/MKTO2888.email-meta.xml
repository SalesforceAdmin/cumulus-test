I have attached the fully executed SOW for your records. Could you also send me a copy of your fully executed agreement with your customer for our records? The last step for you is logging into MBO Access &lt;https://access.mbopartners.com/&gt; and completing the “Industry Expertise” and “Disciplines” sections of your profile. This information needed for our workmen’s comp. policy and must be completed before I can activate your account and get you billing.  Your user ID and password is the same as your MBO Business Center. Evan is done and I will submit him for approval today.  Eliot still owes me his I-9 form and needs to complete his Access profile as well. He contacted me yesterday about it, I will follow up with him again.
Thanks,
Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject: TR I9 and SOW attached.  I think that&apos;s all from me.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  I&apos;ve put the pressure on Eliot.  And I think Evan has everything in, right?I have asked both of them to have hours in the system by EOD Thursday (Oct 31).  I&apos;ll need to approve hours first thing Friday morning - is that possible?  and is there a &quot;how-to&quot;?Tk you!  THR </textOnly>
