    <subject>MBO Partners Independent Consulting Brief - May 2012</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
More than 50% of the workforce will be independent by the end of the decade. That equals an increased need for education, tools and strong content -- all relevant by career stage. Watch this space for a brand-new program we’re announcing this summer to educate consultants at every stage of the journey. Also look for the second annual State of Independence Survey to release this fall. Congrats to our many thousands of small business consultants around the country this National Small Business Month. We feature Jose, an independent from Wisconsin, this month. Read his story &lt;http://gigaom.com/2011/12/08/mbo-partners-network-2011/&gt;.

GEN Y INDEPENDENTS: SOCIALLY ORIENTED AND SERVING NON-PROFITS
One of the more interesting data points from the MBO Partners State of Independence study &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/independent-workforce-index.html&gt; is 22% of Gen Y (born 1980 to 2000 and also referred to as Millennials) independent workers  reported that non-profit organizations were their primary market.

This is substantially higher than any other age group.  On average a bit less than 5% of older respondents reported that non-profits were their primary market.

A number of studies have shown that Gen Yers are more socially oriented than older demographic cohorts.  For example, a recent Pew Research study &lt;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2012/02/young-underemployed-and-optimistic.pdf&gt; found that 22% of Gen Yers (18-34) said having a job/career that benefits society is &quot;one of the most important things in their life&quot; versus only 14% of those older than 35.

This month, we feature advisor Sara Conde, who shares her conversations with a busy consulting practice owner that found an easier, cost effective way to operate his small project-based contracts.

&quot;I really love my job because it allows me to meet, and partner with, successful and interesting people to help make them MORE successful. I love being a true advisor, and empowering them to win new business and grow their consulting practices.”

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. Does MBO Partners offer any medical, dental or group benefits?

A. The answer is YES – and we offer access to true group insurances. This is the same insurance that our corporate employees have access to, including a medical plan, dental, long term disability and life insurance. There is no underwriting required. For consultants accepted to our program, benefits would start the first of the month following activation with MBO Partners. Many of our associates appreciate that we also have some great retirement vehicles that are superior to that of an SEP plan. MBO offers a traditional 401K that Associates can put up to $50,000 a year into pre-tax (and that goes up if you’re over 50). We also offer a Roth 401K for those looking to invest retirement funds but take advantage of tax savings on distributions. For more detailed information regarding premiums, deductibles and coverage amounts, you may wish to book an appointment with a Consultant Services Advisor &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/get-know-few-mbo-consultant-services-advisors&gt; who can provide you with a private link to this information.
