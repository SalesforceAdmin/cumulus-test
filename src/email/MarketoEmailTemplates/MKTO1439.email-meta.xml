Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation. Are you working on a contract/project now or are you currently working W2 at the moment? Thank you and have a great Memorial Day weekend! Nicolette ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
