I noticed you had started the online enrollment but have not quite finished. Please log in and complete the online enrollment as soon as possible. At the end, an I-9 will populate; you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.)  I will also need you to send me a copy of your US passport (you can just take a picture with your phone and email that to me.) I also need you to log in to MBO Access &lt;https://access.mbopartners.com/&gt; and complete the “Industry Expertise” and “Disciplines” sections of your profile. You can do this by clicking on your name in the upper right hand corner and then clicking on “Edit profile &amp; privacy.” This information needed for our workmen’s comp. policy and must be completed before I can activate your account and get you billing. Your user ID and password is the same as your MBO Business Center.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,Meghan  ___________________Meghan MoulConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6359f: 703.793.6473e: mmoul@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:mmoul@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt;  Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
