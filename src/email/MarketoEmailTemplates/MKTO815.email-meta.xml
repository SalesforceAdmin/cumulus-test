You are very welcome, I hope Ann does reach out to you!
 
Congratulations!  Thank you for letting me know, it’s great you are getting a best of both worlds set up J
 
Thank you for referring our services as well!  While I am disappointed I will not have the opportunity to work with you I hope we can help your friends/colleagues make their consulting work less administratively burdensome.
 
I appreciate your kind words, it means a lot and I am happy to answer any questions  for you if you ever have the opportunity to do direct contract work in the future!
 
Good luck with your move and I hope to speak with you again in the future J
 
Nicolette

Nicolette, 
 
Thank you for the referral! I look forward to speaking with Ann. 
On a different note, I had a conversation with my boss today about going 1099. I found out that I&apos;d been reallocated to another Sr. VP, who doesn&apos;t care when or where I work. 
 
So, I get to be a 1099 in practice, but a FT employee on paper. It&apos;s not at all the agreement I envisioned, but it&apos;s absolutely perfect because it will provide me with the flexibility I so need without the anxiety around wondering when I&apos;ll get my next paycheck. 
 
I still love MBO Partners, and I&apos;ve referred this company to at least 5 people in the last month. Right now though, I&apos;ve decided to discontinue my pursuit of this opportunity. 
Thank you for all of your time. It&apos;s been an absolute pleasure working with you.  You&apos;re wonderful and completely talented with what you do. You&apos;re calming, comforting, and an absolute wealth of knowledge.
 
Best Regards, 
Ciara

Hi Ciara,
 
I forwarded your information to some of my coworkers here and one of them forwarded it to a friend of hers named Ann who she thought might be interested so if you hear from her that is where she came from.  I do not have any additional information from her but wanted to let you know.
 
I hope she reaches out and that you can hit your goal.
 
Thanks!
Nicolette

Nicolette, 
 
Thank you so much for agreeing to refer my coaching services to those who may be interested in working with a coach to achieve their biggest goals. 
 
As I we discussed on the phone, I&apos;m a Professional Coach, trained through Accomplishment Coaching, and I&apos;m looking to meet people who have BIG goals and who want to partner with a coach to help them meet their objectives. When I say BIG goals, I work with people who want to create marriage, new jobs, new careers, companies, and well-being. I work with people of all backgrounds and interests who are are seeking to rediscover their CHOICE and retake the reigns of their life to create the life they really want. My goal is to support my clients to make seemingly impossible goals, their realities.  
 
Do you know five people who&apos;d be interested in making a permanent shift in their lives to make their goals their reality?   I&apos;ve attached a copy of my coaching bio, and I offer a 60-minute complementary session to give interested individuals and small business executives an idea of what they can expect from me as their coach!  Why not take a chance, who will you refer?  It could change a life. 
 
Please remember to receive each individual&apos;s permission for me to contact them directly and email me their phone numbers.  Rest assured that I&apos;ll treat your friends, colleagues, and/or family with the utmost love, respect, and confidentiality that I offer everyone. To me, your referrals are dynamos gracing me with their presence. It&apos;s my pleasure to reflect the greatness they already possess as a means to refocus them to achieve their goals. 
 
Thank you! 
 
Ciara
