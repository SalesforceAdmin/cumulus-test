Great to hear!  I’m glad you were able to negotiate a higher rate with them J.  The next steps would be for me to reach out directly to your contact, so I will send Marva an email tomorrow with a copy of our Master Service Agreement to see if they are willing to use that, if not they may counter with their own agreement that I will review.  
 
Once we get the contract process started I will send you an email with the link to enroll in our system (not a huge rush to complete this as we would not activate you for at least a month and a half)  and I will give you further instructions at that time on how to complete the enrollment.
 
If you have any additional questions for me I would be happy to set up another time for us to speak, but the information you provided me will be enough to get started with HPH.
 
I look forward to working with you!
 
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette,
 
Thanks for all of your help and information.  Here is what I was able to work out with Hawaii Pacific Health:
 
1.  1099 hourly rate will be $58
2.  They will continue the weekly invoicing frequency, Net 30
3.  They will be cutting checks
 
Do you need to speak to HPH first, or do we need to talk again to set things up?
 
Here is the contact person at HPH (my supervisor)
 
Marva Chun
Director, PMO
