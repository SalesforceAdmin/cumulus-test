Last question...for now!
 
The initial benefit deposit is based on the premium for whatever benefits I sign up for, correct?

Hi Tom,
 
Great question. The benefits premiums are deduced pre-tax from your business account. If there are no funds in your account the account will go negative and we will use the initial benefit deposit to zero out the balance. If you never need to use the initial deposit it will be refunded to you when you leave MBO and/or cancel your benefits.  Please let me know if you have any questions. I am leaving early today but will respond in the morning.
 
Thanks!
Sara

Got it. Related question that I should have added. What about benefits payments? I know you described that but can&apos;t remember the details. I assume we would need to pay some monthly premium if we were to take on insurance? How is that paid again?

Hi Tom,
 
That is correct with one slight (but important) change, it’s when we receive the funds from the client not when we bill them. The only way MBO gets paid is when your client pays the invoice and sends the money to MBO. This will prompt the funds to show up in your business account and from there  you can decide how you would like to payroll yourself form your business.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
 
Thanks!

Hi Sara,
 
Question for you. We are paid (and pay MBO) only when we bill a client - is that right? I couldn&apos;t find in my notes where I referenced the process.
 
Thanks!
Tom
