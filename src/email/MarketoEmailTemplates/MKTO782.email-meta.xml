Nicolette:
 
My firm is putting forward two nominees to backfill my position so I can retire. As it stands right now, the contract leadership wants me to stay on fulltime for a transition period with the new incumbent until the end of the option year on 31 May 2012. We are expecting a contract extension, which will mean the new incumbent for my job will continue into the following year and we will not have to do a second transition or a period of my covering teaching commitments while a new team comes on board.
 
If I need a contract vehicle for part-time work once I am retired, I understand how to move forward and align with MBO Partners if that turns out to be my best option.
 
Thank you for the follow up.
 
-        Rich

Hello Richard,

I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?

Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one:

MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, theres real hard facts about The State of Independence in America that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent. 
Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Nicolette
