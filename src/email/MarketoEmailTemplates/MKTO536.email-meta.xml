Thanks Steve,

 

Great study and matches with where my head is at.  I hope you and MBO are doing well.  I am still an independent contractor.  My primary client is the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee in the Department of Justice, and I have around 1500 hours a year with them.  I pick up a few smaller projects (e.g. expert witness or sub for one the big firms) when they fall my way.  If you need any expertise with prisons/jails/detention (always a positive subject), I&apos;m here.  Thanks for staying in touch and take care.

 

John

Dear John,

Its been some time since we last spoke with you, but I personally wanted to check in and share some news with you. We recently launched a new consultant-focused Web site which includes relevant tools such as a Bill Rate Calculator, a self-assessment tool on independence, and a video that shows how we help independents succeed in todays project economy. We encourage you to take a look.

Whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.

Please feel free to reply to this email and provide an update on how your contract search is going. Are you working on a project now or you currently working W2 at the moment?

Steven Arhancet
