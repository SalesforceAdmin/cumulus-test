Let’s use the scientific method to go through suggestion. In case you forgot, here are the basic principles that make up the beloved scientific method:   Step 1 – Observation- CSA’s are forgetting to connect with leads on linked in after their first initial contact (via email or phone.) Step 2 – Research – I am hoping to use sales force or marketo to pull a report on which leads in our system have an active linked in account. From there, I would like to extrapolate the percentage of leads that are just hanging out there waiting for a CSA to connect with them. I bet the numbers would show a high percentage. Do I have your permission to reach out to Garret to see if we can get this data? Step 3 – Hypothesis – If we connect with more leads on linked in it will result in more closed leads by adding another “soft touch point” in our sales process.  Step 4 – Experiment – I would like to have the CAS’s (myself, Nicolette,) to go through our list of parked, prospect, and sold and attempt to connect with each consultant who is on linked in. We can do this by gathering the data in sales force and then quickly typing in the names to see if we can find them on linked in. It will take some time to do but it is worth the effort if we close even one additional lead because of this soft touch.  Step 5 – Conclusion – (if the experiment supports my hypothesis) Having a reminder or automated linked in reach out tool in sales force would increase our number of closed leads.  Regards, Dr. Conde___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
