    <subject>Current MBO Partners clients: new IC compliance and engagement service</subject>
    <textOnly>{{lead.First Name:default=Client}},

Independent contractors and consultants – they’re a great way to supplement your staff with hard-to-find talent. But engaging and managing them can be a complex, frustrating challenge. Inconsistent on-boarding, compliance and classification roadblocks, invoices coming from everywhere, payment processing – it all adds up to wasted time, unnecessary costs and endless aggravations.

MBO Partners is here to help. You may already know MBO as a trusted business management solution for independent consultants - but did you know that we can also make engaging ICs easier for you?

MBO introduces IC Engage &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_IC_Engage_Brochure.pdf&gt; – the first turnkey solution for engaging independent consultants that you source on your own. We’ve packaged complex engagement-related best practices – from dozens of successful Fortune 1000 programs – into a powerful, cost-effective, and easy-to-use IC compliance solution for businesses of every size.

With IC Engage, your business can safely and efficiently bring on your independent workforce, even your high-billing, high-profile consultants. This program eliminates reclassification risk entirely while reducing co-employment threats - and it can be up-and-running in as little as one week.

Best of all, it’s easy – you simply refer your ICs to us, and we take care of the rest.

To learn more about how IC Engage can immediately make it easier to engage ICs, call me today at 703-793-6281.

Best regards,

Nicolette Taylor
