You can find the I-9 form in your enrollment documents (if you log in to your account you will see a link that says “enrollment douments”.) Once you have the I-9 you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.)  I will also need you to send me a copy of your US passport (you can just take a picture with your phone and email that to me.) Now all that being said, we sometimes have an issue with notaries in CA so I would like to find one for you so you do not have to go throuh the hassell. What is the closest city to you? 
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: Sentek Supply / Maintenance Systems Market Research Project NDA Hi Sara, Okay it appears I’m now enrolled but I cannot get a copy of the I-9, so that I can print, sign and return. Doug From: DouglasHerman [mailto:douglas.herman@hotmail.com] &lt;mailto:[mailto:douglas.herman@hotmail.com]&gt;

Subject: RE: Sentek Supply / Maintenance Systems Market Research Project NDA I tried again to complete the process. Since I’m not subscribing to all the health…, and only filling out the I-9, I get a “System Error” message that says it has been sent to MBO Technical Support. I’m assuming I don’t fill in anything on the subsequent pages following the I-9, and simply proceed with the next button. Doug From: DouglasHerman [mailto:douglas.herman@hotmail.com] &lt;mailto:[mailto:douglas.herman@hotmail.com]&gt;
