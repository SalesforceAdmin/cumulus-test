It has been a few weeks since our initial call was postponed and I wanted to follow up with you to see if you would still like to speak with me about the services MBO provides.  I have included a link to my calendar below for you to schedule a call that works for your schedule.

I look forward to speaking with you!

Have a great day,
Nicolette
