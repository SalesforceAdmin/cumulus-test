I received the signed contract and SOW today so I will work to get it uploaded in our system and activate you tomorrow morning most likely and at that point we can set up a time to speak so I can walk you through time and expense entry and answer any follow up questions you have.  Please let me know if you would like to speak in the meantime and I would be happy to give you a call.
 
Have a great afternoon,
 
Nicolette

Thanks Nicolette.  I meant to call or email you yesterday to double check on the status of this, but completely forgot.  I did start today so I hope there are no serious issues with that and that we get the paperwork back soon.
 
Let me know if you want to chat tomorrow.  I am planning on being back down on the client site again, but don’t have any particular meetings apart from a 2:00. 
 
Thanks.
Milena

Hi Karen,
 
I was hoping to get an update on the paperwork for Milena, I have not yet received the full executed contract or the completed work order and wanted to make sure that everything was completed since she was supposed to start work today.  Please let me know if I can assist you in any way.
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Hi Milena,
 
I checked with Ryan and Tuesday, September 27th is good for your start date.
 
I will finish up the paperwork that MBO sent over today but if you have any other questions, I suggest you contact Ryan Kauzlick.
 
Thanks,
 
Karen

Hi Karen,
 
Great minds – I was just logging on to check on the status of the paperwork and let you know that I have already put in my two week notice to SRA.  I am available as early as next Tuesday to get started on this project. 
 
I  have some availability today and Monday to chat about next steps as well.  202-498-1084 (cell).
 
Thanks! 
 
Milena

Hi,
 
Milena, will you need to submit at least 2 weeks notice to your current employer? 
 
What is your anticipated start date to work with BRMi? Monday? Two weeks from Monday?
 
Please let me know,
 
Thanks -
