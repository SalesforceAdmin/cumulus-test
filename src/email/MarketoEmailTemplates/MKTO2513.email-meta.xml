I’ve clearly failed in achieving my objective, which was to speak with you, or the person at your company most concerned with safely and cost-effectively engaging your consultants and independent contractors. At this point I can only conclude that you’re not confident that a conversation about the potential value of our solution is worthy of your time, or perhaps you already have a solution that you’re happy with.  If you are on the fence, please click on this link to a white paper called IC Engagement Best Practices &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_ES_White_Paper_Engagement_Best_Practices.pdf&gt; that will provide you with insight into the innovative approach that companies like Microsoft, Siemens, Citibank, and Pfizer are utilizing to mitigate their contract worker reclassification risk, control costs, and attract talent. In either case it would be great to hear confirmation from you so that I can either take you off my list, or we can schedule a time to talk. Kind regards, Steve P.S. Thank you for your time and have a great day! ___________________________________ Steve Taggart Account Executive, Enterprise Solutions MBO Partners t: 703.793.6014 f: 703.793.6452 e: staggart@mboenterprise.com &lt;mailto:staggart@mbopartners.com&gt; w: www.mboenterprise.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt;
