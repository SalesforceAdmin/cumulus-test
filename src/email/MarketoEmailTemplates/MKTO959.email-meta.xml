It was a pleasure working with you up to this point.  We appreciate your on-going business.  As I mentioned you’ll now work with your new Business Manager, Anne Lupardo here at MBO Partners, who will be your one point of contact should you have any questions.  I’ve already informed Anne of important details regarding your working arrangement(s).  As a reminder you may always go to our private informational area for answers to frequently asked questions. 
 
Anne will be reaching out to you shortly to introduce herself.  Lastly, should you be interested in participating in our Meet The Independents initiative we encourage you to share your story with us.
 
Regards,
 
Nicolette
