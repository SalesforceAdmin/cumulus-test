Dear Amanda , 
 
Hello, my name is Sara Conde, a Consultant Services Advisor with MBO Partners.  I received your contact information from Jake Levenson.  Jake has enjoyed our program and thought it would be worthwhile for us to discuss MBO Services to see if it is something that you might find valuable.  You can schedule a convenient time by using my online calendar.
 
I look forward to speaking with you,
 
Sara
