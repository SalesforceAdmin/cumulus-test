Let me once again take the opportunity to take you for your time today; I enjoyed our discussion.  As I expressed, I&apos;ve been a big fan of MBO Partners from my USAID Contract support days when MyBizOffice became our preferred way to reach for Expatriate Independent Consultants.
I&apos;ve attached my most recent resume in support of my candidacy for any open positions.
 
I am a seasoned international professional with over 20 years work experience in emerging markets, developing countries, non-profit and commercial organizations, and US Government funded efforts.  I specialize in strategic planning for program implementation, financial management, contract management, and pricing of services for both Government and Commercial clients.  I am also accomplished at establishing and maintaining financial operations and regulatory oversight of project offices world-wide and am an experienced manager of multinational staff located in the US and overseas.

I believe that my years of experience in the industry, as well as my unique skill set in financial/contract management and pricing offers a virtually no learning curve solution to multiple potential needs within MBO Partners.
 

I look forward to speaking with a recruiting representative in the near future to discuss the potential that my unique skills and experience can offer as you strive to reach your organizational goals.
 

Sincerely,
 
Brian A. Davenport, Ph.D.
