Make sure TASC knows you are going to be running the project though us because I know they will need that information for their SOW. Thank you for the information on the clearance. We actually need a DD-254 from TASC before we can start the paperwork, I will give my security a heads up but you will need to let TASC know to send this over to us.  You may also provide your contact at TASC and we can reach out to start the process, whichever you prefer.  If you would like to run a few rates through our estimate tool I would be the one you would continue to work with on that.  Thanks!Sara From: Mark Clark [mailto:clarkmark7@gmail.com]

Subject: Re: voicemail Okay, thanks Sara.  

Am working a SOW with TASC now.  They will be contacting you at some point but I think it&apos;s too early yet.  I will give TASC your name and contact info.

I&apos;d like to work a cost model for the rate once I get a better sense of the LOE.  Can I do that with you??  

Security:  I will need you to figure in holding my clearance - so I guess that means adding the 1% to the cost.  Here is the info:

Granted/adjudicated a Top Secret clearance with access eligibility to SCI by the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility on 29 March 2012, based upon a Single-Scope Background Investigation/Periodic Reinvestigation conducted by the OPM.  The SSBI/PR was closed/completed on 22 December 2011.  

If I need to speak with someone else on this, just let me know.  Thanks!!

Yes, you are all set up form the MBO side. The next step is to introduce me to your client when this becomes appropriate.  From there, I will take care of all the paperwork and get everything set up for you to bill. Thank you!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9Y2xhcmttYXJrN0BnbWFpbC5jb20mdWlkPTAmZXh0cmE9TVRBd2ZITnlZMmxrUFRNME1IeHRZV2xzYVdROVpqWXpObVF5T1RndFptTmlOUzAwTVRNd0xUbGtNMkl0T1RKa016ZzBORFZtTURBMkxUTTBNSHhtY205dFBYTmpiMjVrWlVCdFltOXdZWEowYm1WeWN5NWpiMjE4YzNWaWFqMTJiMmxqWlcxaGFXdz09JiYm&amp;&amp;&amp;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCeF1Yp0x76u6SdYnqkjTJdtartLEXY52MuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9Y2xhcmttYXJrN0BnbWFpbC5jb20mdWlkPTAmZXh0cmE9TVRBd2ZITnlZMmxrUFRNME1IeHRZV2xzYVdROVpqWXpObVF5T1RndFptTmlOUzAwTVRNd0xUbGtNMkl0T1RKa016ZzBORFZtTURBMkxUTTBNSHhtY205dFBYTmpiMjVrWlVCdFltOXdZWEowYm1WeWN5NWpiMjE4YzNWaWFqMTJiMmxqWlcxaGFXdz09JiYm&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.mbopartners.com/?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCeF1Yp0x76u6SdYnqkjTJdtartLEXY52MuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
