Steve,
After two months of trying connect my contract services with a facility or consulting firm (good propects!), I accepted a W-2 position with a California Medicaid HMO.
 
Let&apos;s stay in touch for the future but i am extremely engaged in the efforts at this HMO and won&apos;t see the light of day for a year.

Seth,
 
I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners and how that would work on your next consulting contract.  I wanted to touch base and find out how that was going.
 
Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
 
This interactive tool shows the value of using a company like MBO as an alternative to incorporation: http://www.mbopartners.com/#whoweareYou can browse through the group benefits you would have access to here: http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-exec-group-benefits
There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract:http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-webcast-index
 
As I mentioned once you find your next contract we can do a financial illustration showing what that income would look like being run through MBO Partners. 
 
If you have questions before then, feel free to schedule a convenient time for you on my online schedule: https://my.timedriver.com/C9CPC.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
