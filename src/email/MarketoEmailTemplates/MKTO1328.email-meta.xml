Subject: Re: Fidelity 401(k) SaraThanks for your candid input yesterday, it is not often that you find someone who knows their business and gets it.  I appreciate it. Regards,Dave908.966.9111On Thu, Feb 23, 2012 at 3:15 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com&gt; wrote:Hi Dave, So nice speaking with you today, the phone number for fidelity is 1-800-294-4015 &lt;tel:908.966.9111&gt; and the plan # 10941. As we discussed Google PEO (Professional Employer Organization) and take a look at what comes up. I think this would be a better fit for your direct marketing consultants. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Take care!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
