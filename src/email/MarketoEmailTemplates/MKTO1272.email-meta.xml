One estimate has no deductible expenses, the other shows $500 in deductible expenses each month. Please let me know if you have any additional questions. 
Thanks,
Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
