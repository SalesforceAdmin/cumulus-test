We use 1920hrs per year as a standard as this builds in time off for sickness, vacation etc.  Our invoicing terms with Man Tech are monthly, net 30. We will invoice them every month for the work done the previous month. Once they receive our invoice they will have 30 days to remit payment back to MBO. When MBO receives the payment it will be posted in your online account with us called your Business Center and from there it will be paid out in the next available pay cycle. We process payroll every Tuesday for a pay date of Friday. Thus, if there are funds in your MBO account on Tuesday (meaning Man Tech paid our invoice) then you will be paid that Friday.  No payment will be made to you until we have payment form Man Tech. You can schedule and manipulate your payroll settings but it will only pay funds out to you if there are funds in your MBO account (meaning the client has paid our invoice.) Let me know if I can clarify any more questions about the net cash, payment terms, or anything else.
Thanks Buddy!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: William Goodwin I-9 and supporting documents Would you be able to work out a projection sheet for the new rate of $60? Also something that wasnt obvious at first. The 160 &quot;units&quot; doesnt account for 2080 hours a year so the yearly total is short. IE 160*12 months = 1920 instead of 2080 (40*52). Can you use 173 &quot;units&quot;?I think the question I was wondering about was pay schedule. I did find a place on the website that will allow me to get paid every 2 weeks. I assume by this, I would have to wait for Man Tech to be billed and pay MBO for the first month and then I would get paid for 2 weeks and the remainder would be in my account at MBO. Is this correct? Thanks,Buddy From: Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt;

Subject: RE: William Goodwin I-9 and supporting documents This is great  thank you! Can you just  put the date in next to your signature in section 1 and resend? E-Verify is picky about that sort of thing.
Thanks again! ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
