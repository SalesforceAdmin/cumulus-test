Thank you for following up with me.  I do want to let you know that what MBO does is provide an alternative to self incorporation to independent consultants.  We do not provide Accountant/CPA services, we actually help to lower the administrative burden of being an independent consultant by helping with things like contract negotiations, invoicing, payroll etc while providing a corporate structure for you to essentially plug your business into.  Also by being an Associate with MBO partners you are protected under our umbrella of professional liability insurances for any contract that you run through MBO Partners.  
 
I have attached a link to a PDF with more information if you are interested in learning further the services we provide.

Thank you again for your response and if you have any questions in the future please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
 
Have a great day,
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette,
 
After careful consideration I&apos;ve realized and decided that my current Accountant/CPA offers much of the same services.
 
Thank you, but I&apos;m gonna pass.

Hi Vartan,
 
Thank you for your response.  I will not be available to speak this evening, would there be a convenient time that I could call you tomorrow?  Currently the times I have available on my schedule are 10:00am EST or 12:30pm EST would either of those work for you?  If not I have a lot of availability on Friday.
 
Thank you again and have a great evening,
Nicolette
