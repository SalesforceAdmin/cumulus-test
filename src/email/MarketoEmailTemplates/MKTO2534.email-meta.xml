    <subject>Updated Research Survey from Aberdeen Group</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Contact}},

Yesterday, you may have received an email about a survey we are conducting on independent consulting talent. Some people responded that they had difficulty completing the survey due to technical errors.

This has been fixed. You can complete the survey here &lt;http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe351672746c077f771476&amp;ls=fdeb1c7172650c7b7c157670&amp;m=fef91275706402&amp;l=fecc1c767464067f&amp;s=fe1f1c747362017f761377&amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;t=&gt;.

Thank you for being part of this important research, and we apologise for any inconvenience this has caused.

 

Sincerely,

The Aberdeen Group
