Hi Nicolette,
 
Sorry I didn&apos;t respond to your earlier email, but things were a bit hectic with the holidays and then a flood of contract opportunities.  I finally landed an 18 month contract with Wells Fargo, doing Infrastructure project management work.  I&apos;ve been on the job for a week and so far so good.
 
I&apos;ll take a look at the resources and pass on any feedback I may have.
 
Dan...

Hello Dan,

I wanted to touch base as a courtesy and see how the contract search is going.

We have a number of consultant resources that we continually update that you may find helpful.   You may find them here: http://www.mbopartners.com/resources.  In addition, if you have any suggestions for new resources that might help other consultants - please let us know!

Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Nicolette
