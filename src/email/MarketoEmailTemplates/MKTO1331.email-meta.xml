Subject: RE: MBO Partners / Thomas Erickson Thanks, Sara.  Considering we had seen each other only a day before Im guessing this was a broadcast to all your current clients. Thank you for the link.  Several of the topics are of great interest to me at present. By the way, I have not had a response from Marcelle yet. Tom From: Sara Conde [mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com] &lt;mailto:[mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com]&gt;
