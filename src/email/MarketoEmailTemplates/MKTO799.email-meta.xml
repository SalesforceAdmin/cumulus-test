Hope you are doing well just wanted to send the enrollment link again (see below.) Please complete your enrollment ASAP so we can get your January invoice in to Exponential. We did ask and they said they would pay the January invoice ASAP as long as it was near one of their two monthly payment dates. I am guessing they cut checks close to the 1st of the month so let’s get you ready to go and put an invoice in their hand ASAP!
 
Feel free to contact me with any and all questions.
 
Thanks!
Sara
