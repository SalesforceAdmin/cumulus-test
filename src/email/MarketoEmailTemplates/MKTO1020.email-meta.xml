I also wanted to point out to you section 2 c where they reference the time line for invoices, just as an FYI.  Please let me know if I have your permission to send to Kim.
Thnk you,Sara Email to Client: Dear Kim  On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with you and your organization.  I have reviewed the agreement and enclosed the revised version with our information.  I have included a copy that lists our changes. Here are the list of changes and explination for each one: 
	- Section 7 e Termination – We need the ability to cancel an engagement if we receive the intent to resign from the assigned consultant  Section __ Non-Compete - We are likely billing your client for other consultants.  What we typically do in this situation is add language to the end of the non-solicitation section, so that we are not in breach when our other members work at your clients. 
 
	- Section 8 Indemnity - We prefer to use our standard indemnity language. 
 
	- Section 8 Damages/Fees – Although we agree to be in breach should there be a violation of this covenant, we prefer not to have the damage or fee amount pre-determined.
 
	- Section 9 Insurace – please list insurace requiemtnes for this project. 
 
	- Section 10 Warrenty - Due to our role as an employer or record for tax purposes and not that of a staffing agency we can not agree repreform or replace.
 If you are curious about MBO Partners and what we do and how we work, we have a short one page overview that may answer some of your questions, which you may access by  &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Introduction.pdf&quot;&gt;going here.I look forward to working with you,   Best regards, Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
