5 WAYS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO PROMOTE YOUR INDEPENDENT CONSULTING BUSINESS
Companies of all sizes are utilizing social media marketing. From Facebook and Google+ accounts to Twitter handles and LinkedIn &lt;http://www.linkedin.com/company/mbo-partners/products?trk=tabs_biz_product&gt; pages, businesses have learned that social media can produce big results. The good news about this medium is that it doesn’t necessarily require the marketing budget of a large corporation to promote your business. Here are five ways that an independent consultant can promote their practice effectively with social media:

1.    Establish Yourself as an Expert

No matter your field, social media is an excellent opportunity to establish your business as a source of expertise. Independent consultants might use Facebook to share breaking industry news, give how-to tips, or opine on hot topics related to their field. Twitter can be used to share helpful articles, or to link back to an informational post on your company blog &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/what-your-blog-says-about-you-tips-blogging-your-way-expert-status-2&gt;. Independent consultants offering professional services may choose to contribute their knowledge on LinkedIn Answers &lt;http://www.linkedin.com/answers&gt;, a forum for professionals to answer questions related to their field of expertise.

This month, we feature advisor Nicolette Taylor, who shares how she provided the resources and support to help an IT consultant do what he already knew he could – become an independent. 

“He had done his homework, was willing to network, and took full advantage of the resources I provided for him. I could tell he had the right mindset; he was ready for independence.”

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. Do I keep my own brand when I work through MBO?
A. Using MBO Partners as your business management vehicle does not affect your own brand identity as a company or independent professional. While we help with all the tasks that drain your billable time, you can feel comfortable knowing you control your identity including branding, websites, business card, and marketing campaigns. We do enjoy sharing helpful tools to build your professional reputation. And, we’ll help you connect and interact with other MBO Partners associates, get your brand in front of more clients, review project opportunities, analyze market data and trends and find business and professional development resources. Our associates appreciate that we even have a library of recorded webinars that help you get started. It’s our job to make it easier for you and your clients to do more business together.
