Subject: Re: MBO Partners Enrollment Information Sara, registered and I need to go over some of that with you also. A couple of times during the process, received error messages trying to move forward. I think I got everything, but I want to address benefits and I need to access material on the benefits to really understand what I am getting.  Also, we have a call scheduled for 0830 PST Wed. Some questions: I checked into local/city taxes and for my situation, told by the city and county that I would not be assessed taxes for such. yet I see I am being charged $144 for that.  Business center and what that means and how I get my money to pay for expenses. Supposedly Sentek Global POC has been working with MBO on my arrangement. I need to find out who they worked this out with, and I need all financial numbers because the govt and I worked and agreed to an amount and I need to make sure Sentek is not taking any more than they are allowed and that my price has not been undercut.  S/ Paul LeBlanc From: Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt;
