I am working with Kim Pert and NW legal to finalize a few of the redlines on the contract. I left a message for their general counsel “Rutledge Simmons” on Friday and I am still waiting to hear back.  There is nothing that I need from you at this time but I will continue to keep you in the loop. On a side note, I was able to Sharon Armstrong all set up in our system so we are moving along! Thanks Randall,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: From: &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&quot;&gt;sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
