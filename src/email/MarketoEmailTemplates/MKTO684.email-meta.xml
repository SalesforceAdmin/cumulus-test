Hi Jake,
 
Unfortunately I am not available tonight but tomorrow morning is wide open for me. You can give me a ring anytime from 9-1pm.  Also, got some good news back from our legal we can leave the risk clause in the contract; so that’s one less thing to worry about. 
 
Looking forward to speaking with you tomorrow!
 
Thanks,

Hi Sara,
I’ve had a chance to review your comments on the proposed contract.  A couple issues I should mention.

Deleting the risk clause will cause IFAW to have to back to their lawyers and cause all sorts of issues on their end.  If it;’s not applicable is there a problem with us leaving it in? Let me check with our legal to see if they would be willing to keep this clause in the contract. 

The part about 15 days notice.  IFAW agreed to give me six months notice.  The reason why I asked for that is that it would be equivalent to a good severance package for an employee. This clause is about exiting the contract. Let’s say you wanted to get another job this is saying you only have to give them two weeks’ notice. If we list this section as 6 months that means that you would also need to give them 6 months’ notice before leaving the contract. So let’s talk about this. 

Regarding 35 hours per week, that was my budgeting over an entire fiscal year, I want to be sure that we’re clear that some weeks will be more and others less. The way it’s written I’m concerned I could get into a situation where a project might go over 35 on one week and I’d just be working as a salaried employee without being able to take time off in lieu. That’s not exactly fair. I am a little confused about which section you are referring to. Let’s touch base on this when we talk on Wednesday. 

The contract’s payment terms are ‘net 30’, that’s not going to work really and it has to be payable by the invoice due date. What this means is that they have 30 days to pay from receipt of the invoice i.e. that would be the due date. What we can do is try to change is to “pay upon receipt of invoice” I am not sure they will go for that but it worth a try. We could also meet in the middle at net 15. 

Thanks,
Jake

Hi Jake,
 
Nice to meet you via email!  I would love to speak quickly with you and get on the same page about the contract. I found some additional items that need to be changed (see redline attached.) If you agree I will send the following email to Val and Patrick and reach out to them via phone. 
 
Looking forward to working with you!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Val and Patrick, 
 
On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with you and your organization.  I have reviewed the agreement and enclosed the revised version with our information.  I have included a copy that lists our changes as well as a clean copy should you accept them for your counter signature. 
 
Here are the list of changes and explination for each one:
 
 
?         Descriptoin of services - Due to our role as an employer or record for tax purposes and not that of a staffing agency we can not attest to the level of skill. 
 
?         Term - We prefer 15 days written notice as this is industry standard. 
 
?         Assumtion of ricsk and Rlease of IFAW-  The work that Jake is providing on this project does not involve a high degree of risk of injury thus, this section is not applicatible. Section 


If you are curious about MBO Partners and what we do and how we work, we have a short one page overview that may answer some of your questions, which you may access by going here &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Introduction.pdf&gt; .
I look forward to working with you,  
 
Best regards,
 
Sara
