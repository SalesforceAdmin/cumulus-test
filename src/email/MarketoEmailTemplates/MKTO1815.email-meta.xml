If funding runs out before the new TO is issued MBO is fine with you continuing to work (as you can imagine this happens often.) However, we do want to be clear that any time you are working outside of a contract/funding you are working at risk of not getting paid. As long as that is ok with you, it is ok with us.  When the funding comes in we simply back bill the time you work.  I think we are doing all we can with TASC to get in front of it at this point. I will keep pestering them until they give me a response. Thanks Ken!Sara From: Kenneth Carter [mailto:kcarter@brunswickconsulting.com]

Subject: Re: FW: MBO Partners PO-0003379 update $36k per year for travel budget.
As per the funding running out, that was my concern and I wanted to know how MBO handled these things - could I log hours at risk, is it a stop work, etc? Basically, I want to know how MBO handles it, and what TASC could do to get in front of it. Thanks.

Could you give me an estimate for a travel budget from August 1st and on? I hear what you are saying about the funding running out and how to precede if/when that is the case. I put the bug in TASC’s ear in the email below to let them know we are concerned about it; I will be interested to see how they respond.
Every client is different when it comes to funding running out so let’s see how they respond, and then adjust our approach accordingly. Have a wonderful weekend,Sara From: Sara Conde

As you know, the current TO runs to 7.31.12 and Ken let me know he would not need travel before then. That being said, he does need a travel budget for the new PO (for August 1st and on.) I will work with Ken on getting an estimate. If funding does not come in by August 1st – what is the protocol? Do we just continue work and then back bill, do we stop work?  Thank you,Sara  From: Harris, Jin K (TASC) [mailto:Jin.Harris@TASC.COM] &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?t=c&amp;enid=bWlkPW1ib0JldGFjdXN0LTAtMC0wLTAtcHJvZC0wJm1zZ2lkPTAmZGlkPTEyMzQmc249MCZlaWQ9a2NhcnRlckBicnVuc3dpY2tjb25zdWx0aW5nLmNvbSZ1aWQ9MCZleHRyYT1NVEkxZkhOeVkybGtQVE0wTUh4dFlXbHNhV1E5TXpZME9UTmpZVGN0WW1ZNU1DMDBZamhoTFRreE16UXRNamd6WVRVeFpXSXlPV1kyTFRNME1IeG1jbTl0UFhOamIyNWtaVUJ0WW05d1lYSjBibVZ5Y3k1amIyMThjM1ZpYWoxR1Z6b2dUVUpQSUZCaGNuUnVaWEp6SUZCUExUQXdNRE16TnprZ2RYQmtZWFJsPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;mailto:%5bmailto:Jin.Harris@TASC.COM%5d?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCcFJYp1Nz%2BdybMLzjjCLJeZOrtLJuHPvy28E5l0txf4alUg%3D%3D&gt;

Subject: MBO Partners PO-0003379 update Hi Sara/Matt – I understand Ken and Sunny have had some inquiries regarding funding and payment.  I have submitted a request to fully fund both Ken and Sunny for the remainder of this option year so there should not be any concerns with working their total negotiated hours of 350 for Ken and 90 for Sunny. Travel for Ken:We did not propose any travel for Ken and I can’t seem to find anything in my records (although I recall seeing something) with an estimate and approval for Ken to travel.  If you can send me this info, I can set up a travel line for Ken. Payment schedule:Although you are on a 45 net, you can run into timing issues depending on when we receive notification of the invoice submission and how long it takes to get through our approval process.  If there is a lengthy delay, please bring it to my attention and I can escalate it for you. If you have any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks!  Regards, Jin Harris
