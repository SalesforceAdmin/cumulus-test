Right now they are effective until the end of July (since you already paid this month’s premium.) Would you like to ask my HR to reverse it out to make it as though you never elected coverage in the first place? If we do that the July premium will be refunded and you will not have coverage for the month of July. Please let me know ASAP. Thanks,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
