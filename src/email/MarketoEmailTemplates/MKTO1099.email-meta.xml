As we discussed our legal will review the consulting agreement, then send it to you for a final review and then we will pass it along to the client copying you.  Please send us your client contact information. It may be best to introduce the client to us in an email. You can say something like: Dear X, I would like to introduce you to Nicolette Taylor and Sara Conde, they manage my account at MBO Partners, a firm that handles my billing and back office.  Here is some quick info on how they work. Thanks, David  We can then pick it up from there. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions while Nicolette is out. Thank you!Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: New client wants to move quicklyHi Nicolette,

I have a new partner that would like to move quickly on this project and would like to start Monday for a three month contract.  Attached is the SOW and Consulting agreement.  I&apos;d like to speak with you on an approach.  I unfortunately have a meeting until 2:15 and then a call with Return Path at 3pm.

Are you available for a few minutes today to talk?

Dave LaBerge
