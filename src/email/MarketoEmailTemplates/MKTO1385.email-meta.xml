Subject: Re: MBO Partners - Time Card Reminder Thanks for the reminder, Sara.Fixed it. Please let me know if there is any data missing.  At this time, I do notice a $49 charge for dental.  This should be unnecessary since I am back with DC government; dunno if this is an expense that can be removed, however. As mentioned, I AM able to do the RK &amp; Associates side business, so it&apos;s still my intention to work with MBO. Russell   On Sun, May 13, 2012 at 6:56 PM, &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:According to our records, there is no time entered in the period indicated for the following work order(s):
