	- Here are some time and expense entry instructions for using our system.	- Here is a copy of our expense policy.	- Here is a list of the most common expenses &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf&gt; you can submit to MBO.
The next step is to schedule another time  that works for you so we can do a walk-through of the business center and I can show you all the great features. I look forward to working with you! Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
