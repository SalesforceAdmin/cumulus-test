Hope you are doing well. I wanted follow up on my voicemail. When you have a moment could you give me a quick ring; I want  to touch base on 3 items:
 
·         Sending in money to MBO for the payment of 50% of your deliverable (which you have already received from  you client)
·         Discuss a few additional licensing questions.
·         Get your client’s contact information (when you are ready.)
 
Thanks Tom!
Sara
