    <textOnly>Hello,

A couple of weeks ago, I invited you to register for an upcoming Human Capital Institute Webcast titled “Why HR Should Own Independent Contract Talent Management and How to Do It.” It promises to be a very informative discussion, and if you haven’t had the opportunity to register yet it’s not too late. 
 
This event features a panel of prominent HR and Talent Acquisition executives discussing best practices in the human capital management of their independent contract talent. 

Date: Wednesday, September 12, 2012 at noon ET 
 
(Not a good time for you? There are recasts on September 13 and 14 also available to you)
 
Registration: Click here to register &lt;http://www.hci.org/lib/why-hr-should-own-independent-contract-talent-management-and-how-do-it&gt; 

We are anticipating a great turnout and hope you can join the discussion.

Warm regards, 
 
Steve

P.S. If you think this may not be right for you, but you have a colleague who might be interested, please consider passing this invitation along.
