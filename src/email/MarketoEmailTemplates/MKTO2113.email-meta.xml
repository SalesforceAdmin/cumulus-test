    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},


Thank you for signing up to receive the Contractor Engagement Quarterly from MBO Enterprise Solutions!


As you may know, there’s a “perfect storm” brewing where it comes to independent contractor engagement. While workers are increasingly choosing independence and forward-thinking businesses are using ICs more frequently, new and potentially devastating regulations throw a blanket of fear and confusion over it all.


MBO wants to help steer your business away from the storm. With over 25 years of real-world IC engagement experience – not to mention a finger on the pulse of key IC legal issues – MBO has the expertise to help your business maximize its return on every consulting dollar… safely.


Each edition of the Contractor Engagement Quarterly is packed with stories, advice, blog links, and useful educational tools. We hope these help you meet the challenges that go hand-in-hand with engaging independent workers.


For more information about MBO Enterprise Solutions and our independent contractor engagement solutions, please call us at 1-800-220-0469, email us at sales@mboenterprise.com, or visit our website at www.mboenterprise.com . We look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
