Subject: MBO Partners / Kenneth Milstead (BioMimetic Therapeutics) Sara and Megan, This is just a quick note to introduce you to each other. Megan, Sara is the person who will be dealing with contract and billing issues for MBO Partners. Sara, Megan is an executive recruiter who will be dealing with contract issues. You will also need to have contact with the client (BioMimetic Therapeutics). Megan will provide their contact info and make the appropriate introductions. I know that you both have my contact info, but I&apos;ll include it here as well for easy reference. Sara, we need to have this contract written by Wednesday or Thursday so that it can be reviewed by the BioMimetic Therapeutics contracts committee on Friday (July 27). Megan can provide more information on this process and on deadlines. Assuming the committee is in agreement, we hope that I can begin working with the client on Monday, July 30. I look forward to talking with both of you during the week  Thanks,Ken Sara CondeConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partnerst: 703-793-6028f: 703.793.6081e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPXByb2QtbC0yOTcmbWVzc2FnZWlkPTI5NyZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEzMzQ4ODg2OTgmc2VyaWFsPTEyNjQ4OTI2MDImZW1haWxpZD1taWxzdGVhZEBtZWRlbGxlLmNvbSZ1c2VyaWQ9bC0xMjgtMjAwMjYtMTEwMTkwMi0xJmV4dHJhPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.mbopartners.com/?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRons67JZKXonjHpfsX56uwsUKe0lMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ATsFrI%2FqLAzICFpZo2FFVGO8%3D&gt;Megan LisieckiPresident &amp; CEOKingston ONeill SearchT: 919.346.1264 x227 F: 877.876.9496C: 919.559.3815E: Megan Lisiecki &lt;megan@kingstononeill.com &lt;mailto:megan@kingstononeill.com&gt;&gt;
