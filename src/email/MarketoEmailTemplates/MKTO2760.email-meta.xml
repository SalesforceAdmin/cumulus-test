The game has changed; if you&apos;re self-employed, you need the right technology to support your solo business.
Since we can&apos;t all be IT experts, MBO Partners has created the Technology 101 downloadable guide &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide/launch/technology-101&gt;. It&apos;s packed with tips and tricks specifically tailored to the self-employed.
If you have any further questions about independent consulting tech or being self-employed, please don&apos;t hesitate to ask.
