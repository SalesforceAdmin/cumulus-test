    <textOnly>Please join us on Wednesday, November 20 at 1 p.m. ET, when we will hold a webinar titled &quot;Workflow and Time Management Tips for the Self-Employed Workforce &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/20NovWebWorkflowMgmt_RegistrationPage.html&gt;.&quot;

As an independent, you have the freedom to complete projects on your own schedule. However, that&apos;s not always as easy as it sounds. As a business of one, juggling requests from multiple clients while also taking care of your back office can be challenging.
To help you make the most of your working hours, MBO Partners is inviting expert executive consultant, facilitator and trainer Perry Pockros to our webinar series. Perry will present a 3 part workflow framework to maximize the efficiency of your solo business. 
Register today &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/20NovWebWorkflowMgmt_RegistrationPage.html&gt;!
