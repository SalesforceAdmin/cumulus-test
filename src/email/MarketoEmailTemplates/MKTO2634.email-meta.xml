    <subject>46% of companies see ICs as a competitive advantage</subject>
    <textOnly>The Aberdeen Group has just published a game-changing new research report on independent contractor engagement, and I thought you&apos;d be interested in reading it.

The research reveals that companies using an ICES like MBO Partners are better able to mitigate risk, improve IC satisfaction, and deliver business results. Don&apos;t take my word for it; feel free to review the executive summary &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Aberdeen-execsummaryMay2013.pdf&gt; yourself, and if you want to find out more, you can read MBO&apos;s analysis in our new blog. &lt;http://mboenterprise.com/blog/enterprise-research-validates-roi-independent-contractor-engagement-specialists&gt;

If you have any questions about anything you find in the report, please feel free to email or call me to discuss.

Best regards,

Steve
