CEO CORNER

GOING SOLO

I’ve made some bold predictions on the future of the independent work.  By 2020, I firmly believe that independent workers will be the majority.  As an Associate of MBO, you are an independent professional and you are leading the way to the new way to work. I want to thank you for your leadership and for your help in making 2011 a great year for MBO Partners.  We are growing fast, building a lot of resources, and getting a lot of attention.  2012 looks to be an even better year for all of us.  If you haven’t already seen this, you may want to check out my interview with ABC’s Tory Johnson as I discuss the growing trend of going solo. Watch Video: http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/quit-job-solo-15115964

I wish you a prosperous and fulfilling New Year!




CTO CORNER

IN-DEMAND CERTIFICATIONS SURE TO IMPRESS

Whether we like it or not, it’s not only our experience that matters in the IT world. Certifications play a big role in how prospective clients view our skills. Most of us have collected a number of them over the years, but since technology and demand changes, we have to work hard to keep them up to date. There’s a lot to choose from, and sometimes it’s tough to know which ones to work on. Of course, it depends on what your current skills are and what kind of work you want to do. To great extent, it also depends on where the demand is going to be (my Z80 assembly language skills are unlikely to be in high demand this year).
