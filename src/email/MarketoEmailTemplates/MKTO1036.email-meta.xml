Subject: Names for Possible Referral Hi Sara, Sorry to bother you with a series of names for referrals, but I have by chance discussed your organization with a few colleagues over the past few days. Who will probably contact you in the near future: Kurt MurphyJohn Phillips The others mentioned and a few others are firmly going the LLC route and will not approach MBO. Mike</textOnly>
