We have not received anything from TWC yet for Kevin. I will follow up with Chris Hill on this. Matt can touch base with you on the outstanding invoices with TWC but the last I saw on this was an email from TWC on 5.9.12 stating that the invoices would be processed that day. It’s hard to understand why we have not received them yet but I want to check with Matt before we follow up again.  He is out of the office today and will be back on Monday. In terms of legal language to add to TWC agreement (once we receive it that is) I think we can stick to something simple. It would need to be based off of the language in the contract but in general I think something like this would do: “When and if consultant Kevin McCarron is awarded a full time position with The Weather Channel, consultant Mike Buchkovsky shall invoice a finder’s fee in the amount of XXXX. The finder’s fee is to be paid by The Weather Channel upon receipt of invoice.” Thanks Mike,
