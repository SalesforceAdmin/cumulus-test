    <subject>Why Fight Red Tape to Get Your Next Contract?</subject>
    <textOnly>Are you finding it difficult to secure contracts with the organizations you want to work with? 

MBO Partners already has hundreds of master service agreements in place - including with 40 percent of the Fortune 100. We&apos;re also an approved GSA vendor. 

If you choose to work through MBO, you will still find your own contracts and maintain your own network. But you can finally stop fighting vendor red tape rules – and start billing for projects faster. 

Focus on what you do best, and let MBO’s back-office management team take care of everything else. 
Email info@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:info@mbopartners.com&gt; today to learn more, or give us a call at 1-800-220-0469.
