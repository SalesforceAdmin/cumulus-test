Subject: Getting Claude Hill setup with MBO Hey Claude, We&apos;re excited to work with you, and I&apos;ll send over a contracting agreement to you shortly. In the meantime, I&apos;d like to start the process of enrolling you with MBO Partners as we&apos;d briefly discussed earlier. I think Sara will do the necessaries, but the end result is that you&apos;ll be a W2 employee of MBO Partners, and on a weekly basis (by 5pm friday) you&apos;ll enter your hours worked both in the clarity system at The Gap and in the MBO form. At the end of the month MBO will invoice us for your hours, we&apos;ll pay them and they&apos;ll pay you. I used MBO for many years and liked them. I suggest looking into and taking advantage of their SEP additions to their 401k plan We&apos;re aiming for a 12/2 start date, which I hope is doable even with your planned trip to MD.</textOnly>
