Dear Kevin, 
 
You had recently shared your phone information with MBO Partners, and as a courtesy, I wanted to follow up on the voicemail I left you.  I wanted to introduce myself as the person at MBO Partners responsible for all new associate and partnership requests. I am including my contact information.  And, so you may easily book a time that is convenient for you, I am including a link to my online schedule: https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK
 
You can also watch a short video about who we are on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKDzwSTmGv4&amp;hd=1.
 
You may also look at some of the stories from indepdenents who use MBO Partners:

I look forward to speaking with you, have a great day!
 
Thank you,
Nicolette
