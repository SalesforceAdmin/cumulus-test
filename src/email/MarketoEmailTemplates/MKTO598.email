Keith,

Congrats on the first proposal.  I would suggest we talk more about our services.  We are by far a superior alternative to setting up an LLC (if you are just doing professional consulting to business clients).  Were much easier to set-up and you retain all the same tax benefits of having an LLC.  You can easily book a time that works for you using my online schedule by going here.

Subject: Fr Keith Chirico Re: LLC & Proposal Assistance

Steve,

I am considering my first proposal but have yet to establish an LLC.

Working full time and departing OCONUS in a few weeks has been keeping me busy, however, I don't want to miss this first opportunity.

Does MBO have any info or resource that outlines the "how to" LLC in VA?

Provide assistance in establishing an LLC?  Assistance with proposals?

What would be the fee for these services?

Thanks in advance!

Regards,

Keith
