You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.)  I will also need you to send me a copy of your US passport (you can just take a picture with your phone and email that to me.) Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: MBO MSA Hi Danielle and Tim, Thank you for turning this around so quickly. All changes were accepted with the exception of the proposed removal of “if MBO can recover the expenditure from the Associate.” in section 9. Once services are accepted and paid, we cannot accommodate refunds as we have already paid consultants for their labor and expenses. If you agree please sign the attached and return fully executed copy via email.  Net 30 payment terms are fine, please find updated SOW attached, complete sign and return this as well.  Thank you,Sara From: Danielle Clay [mailto:dclay@paragontech.net] &lt;mailto:[mailto:dclay@paragontech.net]&gt;
