My name is Sara Conde and I will be your contact at MBO moving forward. Since we have a contract with OST Global solutions you would be covered under our liability insurance if you ran the project through MBO.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions or if can be of help. 

Looking forward to working with you!

RE: Liability insurance coverage status for Nicholas Fattu
 
 
I need to check on the status of my enrollment for the MBO liability insurance coverage.
 
I have a potential assignment through OST Global Solutions, Inc. and they wanted me to ensure that I had the coverage.
 
I had coverage last year for a short assignment during the March-April time period.
 
 
Thanks,
 
 
Nick Fattu
