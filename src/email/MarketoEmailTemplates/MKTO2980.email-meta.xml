Lin – it’s nice to meet you via email. MBO is qualified to do direct business with the US Government; you can find our GSA schedule information here &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_GSA_Price_List.pdf?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCc1RYsl5W4vGYJaz%2Fhi2OeZel0dYXY52MuKVUsyIUGIalUg%3D%3D&gt;. We mostly end up billing through large government integrators (i.e. BAH, Lockheed, Raytheon, SAIC etc.) as they are the ones to who have access to government opportunities. To my knowledge we only have one direct US Government client at this time; Millennium Challenge Corporation &lt;http://www.mcc.gov/&gt;, we have also worked with USAID i &lt;http://www.usaid.gov/&gt;n the past. So, to summarize, we have the credentials to work directly with the USG (especially within DOD) but usually end up going through an approved government integrator that already has the relationship.
I hope this helps, please let me know I if you have any additional questions.  Thank you,Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject: Introducing Lin Wells to MBO Partners Dear Sara, This email is to introduce you to Lin Wells, who is the Director of the Center for Technology and National Security Policy at the US National Defense University. I have told Lin about your services and your website at www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com&gt;.  I am also  attaching for his interest the general brochure and the one about security clearances.  Lin and I both have the same question, which is what USG contracts is MBO Partners presently aligned with that would allow DoD clients such as OSD and NDU in his case, and the US Pacific Command in my case, to send money to in order to get it onto contract for  consultant work through MBO partners. We look forward to your reply.    Best regards,
