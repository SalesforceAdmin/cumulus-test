After you have a chance to browse through the information, if you would like to hear more about the MBO Program please schedule a call by following the link to my calendar at the end of this email.  The structure of the call would go as follows:  I would ask you a few questions about how you run your business, what line of work you are in and what you were looking for when seeking information regarding our services so that I can determine if you are a good fit for our program.  Assuming you are a good fit, I would then go through, step by step what solutions we provide for you as an independent consultant as well as the details of how you would operate within our program.  Once I have walked you through the program I would answer any additional questions you have about our services and we can talk about next steps if that is what you decide.
 
 
As I mentioned if you would like to hear more about our program feel free to schedule a convenient time using my online schedule: https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK
 
Have a great day and I look forward to speaking with you!
 
Thank you,
Nicolette
