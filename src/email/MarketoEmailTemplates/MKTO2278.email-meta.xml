    <subject>Important Social Security Notice from MBO Partners</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Consultant}},
This week, President Obama signed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (better known as the “Fiscal Cliff Bill”) into law.
Among other things, the Act eliminates the 2% reduction in employee-side Social Security tax that had been in place during 2011 and 2012. As a result, your 2013 Social Security tax liability will increase by 2% to its pre-2011 level.
Also note that the 2013 Social Security wage base limit has increased to $113,700. This means that MBO Partners will withhold Social Security tax on the first $113,700 of your 2013 billings.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Best regards,
