Please try this and let me know. Thanks!Sdara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: Error in MBO Partners Online Enrollment Yup - just tried one more time - I keep getting that error.  I&apos;ve gone back and checked my submitted answers and data.  All seems right on this end.

Let me know if your support team can help troubleshoot this.  I don&apos;t want this to hold up start dates and such.

Subject: Error in MBO Partners Online Enrollment Sara,

Good morning - I hope you had a great weekend.

I have been trying to complete my online enrollment within the MBO Partners dashboard for the past few days.  I&apos;ve entered all my information for W-4, I-9, etc. - but get an error when I try to complete the enrollment.

I&apos;ve attached a screenshot - it&apos;s not a very descriptive error message, but that&apos;s what I&apos;m getting.

Can you advise how I should proceed to get this completed?

Kevin
