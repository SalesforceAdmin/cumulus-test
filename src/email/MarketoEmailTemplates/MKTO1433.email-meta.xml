Subject: Re: MBO Information and Net Cash Estimates Hi, Nicolette, hope you&apos;re having a pleasant holiday as well as some high quality time off. I have a few consulting opportunities that may gel in January.  I&apos;d like to enroll with MBO so we can hit the ground running when the time comes.  I&apos;d like to connect with you next week if possible. Please refresh me on getting into your appointment scheduling system.  Thanks, and Happy New Year! Mark
