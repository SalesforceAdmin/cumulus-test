You have completed the online enrollment; the last step is sending me a copy of your I-9 form. You did provide this to us perviousloy but unfortuently the form has expeired so we will need an updated one. I have attached an updated  I-9 for you, the password to open is the last 4 digits of your SSN. Once the document is is open you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I dont need a hard copy.)  I will also need you to send me a copy of your US passport (you can just take a picture with your phone and email that to me.) I would also like to walk  you through a net cash estimate so you can get a feel for the way the cash flow works with MBO. Please give me a ring when you have about 10 minutes and can be infront of a computer and we will walk through this.  Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: [FWD: RE: Conference call] Hi Paul,  It looks like Jim started the enrollment for the EXEC program back in 2009 but never actually finished the onboarding process. I have copied  Sara who should be able to help him get onboarded.

Subject: [FWD: RE: Conference call] Jackie, What&apos;s the status of Jim Kuiken with MBO Partners? Is he a 1099 inactive consultant or a W-2 MBO Partners inactive employee? Since he hasn&apos;t been active for two years, does he have to start from scratch to get back in the MBO Partners process? Paul -------- Original Message --------

Cc: Paul Shahady &lt;paul.shahady@seniorexecutiveservices.com &lt;mailto:paul.shahady@seniorexecutiveservices.com&gt;&gt;Jean, Thanks for responding so quickly. I dont have a specific opportunity, but Ive been out of the loop for a while (about 2 years), and want to get reacquainted with SES Services, updating my profile, how I log in and manage my profile, how to engage if/when I bring an opportunity in, fees, etc., etc.  As you can tell, I havent really been paying attention to consulting while I was busy setting up and running for public office.  Im back in the saddle now, and need to re-engage, and basically need a full spin-up again so Im back on track with the company and how to use your services.  When he recruited me, Bill got me up to speed pretty well, but thats been a long time ago. Let me know if you, Paul, and/or someone else is the one to go over everything (pretty much from scratch, as if I were a brand new TT member), and we can set up the call. Thanks again,Jim From: Jean James [mailto:jean.james@seniorexecutiveservices.com &lt;mailto:jean.james@seniorexecutiveservices.com&gt;]
