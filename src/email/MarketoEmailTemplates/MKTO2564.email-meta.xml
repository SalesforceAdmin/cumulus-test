    <subject>Contractor Engagement Quarterly - Q2 2013</subject>
    <textOnly>Q2 FOCUS: 2013 WORKFORCE TRENDS 
In the Q2 CEQ, we ask the question: what are the trends affecting the independent workforce in 2013? There are several questions that arise. How will the Affordable Care Act affect consulting? What new cases will set precedents on the misclassification of independent consultants? Will the state unemployment, IRS and DOL ever share the same view on how to test for IC classification?

We are hard at work finding answers to these questions, and this newsletter is full of tools and thoughts to help you make sense of them yourself. Be sure to sign up for our Webinar &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/Apr30WebinarAffordableCare.html&gt; on April 30th, when I will interview both a legal and an economic expert on the answers to the biggest questions surrounding independent contractor engagement.
