Thanks for the calls yesterday.  As I mentioned, we would be comfortable signing the contract without the revision in Article 8 to avoid any concerns expressed by TAS and also enable you to work through MBO on this project.  Please let me know how your conversation goes with Thea. 
 
Thanks,
 
Steve
