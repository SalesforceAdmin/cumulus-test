Dear Sara,
 
Good afternoon.  I have a client lined up..!
 
A professional acquaintance has called me to request tenant/lessee presentations to three properties within her Property Management companies&apos; portfolio.  3 dates should take place and I&apos;ve promised this prospect a work proposal.
 
I&apos;d like to share it with you later today and discuss it&apos;s strengths, etc. as well as the appropriate price point.
While I need to turn this around by Wednesday, I am still waiting for her to answer some questions I requested from her own colleagues -- those managing these properties.
 
Hope to catch you later today.
 
Russell

Hi Russell,
 
I received your passport, thank you! The next step is to get me in touch with your client (when that becomes appropriate.) You are good to go from the MBO side.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
