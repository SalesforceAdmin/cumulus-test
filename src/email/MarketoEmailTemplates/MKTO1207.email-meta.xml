Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Elaine Oberman Hello Sara, I have really not mounted an aggressive search in the six weeks since my last contract wrapped up.  Have contacted my network to discuss options that some of them may have early in the summer but are not yet available; in the meantime, I am still trying to finish the remodeling projects I started in March and expect them to be resolved the end of April or, possibly, the middle of May. Thanks for the consultant resource link--appreciate it.  If there is anything I can add, I will let you know. Regards, Elaine
