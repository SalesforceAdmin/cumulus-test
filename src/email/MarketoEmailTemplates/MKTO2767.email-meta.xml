Please see updated version of the agreement attached. You can see all the back and forth we have had about section 6 Disallowance of Payments below. Any insight you can provide on this section would be great. Again, we will sign section 6 as is but I want to make the case to my CEO that we DON’T need to hold 10% of your income until 30 days after the end date.  We are also working on hammering out section 10 indemnity as well but there is nothing you need to do for that section.  Thanks,Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject: RE: MBO Requested Changes Hi Kathia, I just wanted to follow up on the voicemail I left you earlier this afternoon.  My colleague Sara Conde whom I believe you left a message for earlier is working with another consultants that is working with the same end client as Wole and I think there is miscommunication on the hold up’s with the contract so I wanted to have a brief conversation with all 3 of us to clarify and hopefully get the contract finalized for this other consultant that Sara is working with. Please let me know when would be a good time to give you a call tomorrow and I will call you with Sara. Thanks and have a great evening,Nicolette From: Kathia Juste [mailto:Kathia.Juste@acentia.com &lt;mailto:Kathia.Juste@acentia.com&gt;]

Subject: RE: MBO Requested Changes Hi Kathia, I received feedback from my contracts team regarding this item and their response to me was the following.  MBO is not comfortable with leaving this clause in the agreement.  The Contractor in this case is Acentia since you have the contract with the Federal Contracting Officer.  Our Contract is with you (Acentia) and the flow down of this to MBO is unfair since we are not agreeing to nor do we have control over what Acentia has agreed to deliver to your client.  Wole will deliver what Acentia tells him to, but the flow down of this FAR to us should not be required.  MBO is a sub to Acentia and we believe you can remove the flow down and take the risk.  At a minimum we should be able to see the contract Acentia has with the Feds and Wole should review to make sure he feels comfortable that it can be delivered.  Please let me know if you have any questions about this and I would be happy to speak with you. Thank you and have a great weekend,Nicolette  From: Kathia Juste [mailto:Kathia.Juste@acentia.com &lt;mailto:Kathia.Juste@acentia.com&gt;]

Subject: RE: MBO Requested Changes Hi Nicolette, We’ve reviewed the suggested language, however, we still cannot accept this change. If the government requests that we refund the payments received, we are still required to return those funds regardless of whether the funds were already disbursed. Because of this, we are flowing that term down to our subcontractors as well.

Subject: RE: MBO Requested Changes Hi Kathia, I heard back from my contracts team and first of all, thank you for the changes that you have accepted.  I wanted to have a quick conversation with you about the changes requested that you have notated that you cannot accept as we are willing to leave 10b and 18a7 as is, but for section 6d (Disallowance of Payments) we cannot leave as is.  We could accept adjusting the language to say (see bolded section): Disallowance of Payments:  If Company is required, because of any action of the Customer for which the Task Order is issued, to refund or credit to the Customer any amount with respect to an item of cost for which Company had reimbursed the Subcontractor, the[NT1] &lt;#_msocom_1&gt;                Subcontractor shall, use it’s best efforts to recover the funds from Subcontractor’s employee the amounts requested. If Subcontractor is able to recover the funds, Subcontractor will promptly repay to Company the disapproved amount[NT2] &lt;#_msocom_2&gt;                 The reason we are unable to promptly repay upon demand is because we will pay Wole once we receive payment from you, so the funds are not with MBO at that point.  We can say that we will use our best efforts to recover the funds and if we are able to get them back from Wole then we will return them to you.   Please let me know if you would like to discuss this in further detail. Thank you and have a great day,Nicolette  From: Kathia Juste [mailto:Kathia.Juste@acentia.com &lt;mailto:Kathia.Juste@acentia.com&gt;]
