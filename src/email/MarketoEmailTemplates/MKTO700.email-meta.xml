Thank you for your interest in MBO Partners.  Do you plan on working with Proposal Development Consultants again this year for your consulting work or have you found your own clients and you would like to run your billings through MBO for that work?
 
Please advise and if you have any additional questions for me please do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Thanks!
Nicolette
