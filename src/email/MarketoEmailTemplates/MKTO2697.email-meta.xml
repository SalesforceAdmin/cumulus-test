William,
MBO Partners helps independent contractors get to work quickly and easily - even with the biggest and most complex clients.
Once you have your contract, MBO can guide you through the entire process, from insurances to making sure all that paperwork is done correctly.
Check out this story &lt;http://link.mbopartners.com/trk?t=2&amp;mid=Njg4LU5QTS01MjU6MjMzMzozMjkwOjExNTc1OjA6MjYzMjo3OjEyMjc0NzE6YmlsbEB3d2NvbnN1bHQudXM%3D&amp;&amp;&amp;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/CSA-Story-July_2013.pdf?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRoluaXJZKXonjHpfsX56e4qXaC3lMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4DSsFgI%2BSLDwEYGJlv6SgFTLjNMa5w17gIWRQ%3D&gt; about a consultant who was able to leverage MBO to get to work with a dream client in the Fortune 100.
Have any questions about how MBO made it easier? Just email me to learn how MBO could help you get to work once you get a contract as a professional services contractor with a Fortune 500 company. ___________________________________
