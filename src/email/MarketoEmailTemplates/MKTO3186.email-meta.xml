    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

I hope you&apos;re doing well. We’re reaching out because we know you have had an interest in MBO Partners in the past.

I&apos;d like to share a few of our resources designed specifically for independent consultants. If you haven&apos;t already, check out our Bill Rate Calculator &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/#billrate&gt;,  an interactive tool that can guide you in creating a rate that includes your operating expenses, estimated billable hours and target profit margin.  

Additionally, we have created an online library of content relevant to both new and experienced independents. It&apos;s called the Independent&apos;s Guide &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide&gt;, and it&apos;s constantly updated with new articles, blogs, and downloadable guides. We even have custom templates you can use for creating a Statement of Work &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide/launch/creating-independent-consulting-scope-work-document-tips-and-template&gt; document. 

As always, we’re here to make it easier for independent consultants to do business. If you would like to chat, you may book a time in my online schedule by going here {{lead.EM TTLink:default=https://my.timedriver.com/8SLYS}}

Best regards,
