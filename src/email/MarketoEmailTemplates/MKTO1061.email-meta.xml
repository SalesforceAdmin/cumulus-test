Sometimes people sign our MSA and the whole thing is worked out in 30 minutes. Sometimes people want us to speak with their attorney and that can take a bit longer. I wouldnt say this is difficult they just want to do a good job and make sure they understand our changes. Their lawyer is really amicable and willing to work with us so at this point its really just a matter of paper work. I will continue to keep you posted. Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: From: &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&quot;&gt;sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: RFQ Application (R. Thacker) Hi Sara, I&apos;m getting the feeling this is extra complicated for them.  Is it usually this difficult?

Below I am going to site the original changes requested and where we stand after our call this morning in red.  
	- Section 7 e Termination  We need the ability to cancel an engagement if we receive the intent to resign from the assigned consultant. No need for this change in umbrella agreement as we can list this change in SOW. 
 
	- Section __ Non-Compete - We are likely billing your client for other consultants.  What we typically do in this situation is add language to the end of the non-solicitation section, so that we are not in breach when our other members work at your clients.  Please confirm our added lanague to this seciotn is acceptable. 
 
	- Section 8 Indemnity - We prefer to use our standard indemnity language. On the attached contract you will see MBOs suggested edits to your indemintiy lanaguage as we discussed. In secton 8(a) we removed sectoin (i) as our liablity insurace doesnt cover this.  We removed all of sectoin 8(b) as any itellectual prrotery would be the property of NeeighborWorks under this agreement, thus, this sectoin is unecessary.  In section 8(c)  we removed all sections save section (a) as we dont want the damaged to be pre-determined. 
 
	- Section 8 Damages/Fees  Although we agree to be in breach should there be a violation of this covenant, we prefer not to have the damage or fee amount pre-determined. We did not go into this on the phone call but is covered in  the indeminty edits in seciton 8 c above. 	- Section 9 Insurace  please list insurace requiemtnes for this project. A sample of our liablity insurance is attached, please update the doument with this information. 
 
	- Section 10 Warrenty - Due to our role as an employer or record for tax purposes and not that of a staffing agency we can not agree repreform or replace. We  added to the best of MBOs abilty to this seciont as discussed.
 Please let me know if these changes are acceptable.
