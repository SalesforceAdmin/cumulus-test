Hello, my name is Steven Arhancet, Enrollment Advisor with MBO Partners.  I received your contact information from John Capozzi, who has enjoyed our program and thought it would be worthwhile for us to discuss MBO Services to see if it is something that you might find valuable.  You can schedule a convenient time by using my online calendar: https://my.timedriver.com/C9CPC. 
 
You can also watch a short video about who we are on youtube:

I look forward to speaking with you,
 
Steve
