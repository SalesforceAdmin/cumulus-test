It has come to our attention that you may have accidentally received a message stating you did not attend Friday&apos;s webinar. There was an error in distribution. We apologize for any inconvenience. You should also have received a second message including the slides and links mentioned in the Webinar.

Thank you again for attending, and for your interest in MBO Partners!
