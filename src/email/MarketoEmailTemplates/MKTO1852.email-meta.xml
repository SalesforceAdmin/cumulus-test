Since your project is on hold right now what we will do is close the MBO account. You will still have access to the Business Center and if you get called back to work re-enrollment is quick and easy (you just confirm your information and we switch you back to “active” in our records. ) Hope you have a wonderful weekend – I will send you the official email about being in “alumni” status shortly. Again, nothing really is changing, it is just for our record keeping (from an HR perspective we can’t have people as active employees who are not billing for a long period of time - that’s all.)  Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks John!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
