Subject: Re: MBO Partners Payment Notification for Sumit Shrimavle (20114) Hi Sara, I still see the invoice number 353466 &lt;https://app1.mbopartners.com/servlet/entry?display=InvoiceUpdateMember&amp;id=20120319184509290119000000&gt; as open in the MBO system with a balance of 77.50. As discussed, this was an error on my part on the timesheet and there shold not be a balance. The amount which Crescent had sent, amount = 6,781.25 for 43.75 hours for weekending 03/18/12 is correct. Can you please update the MBO invoice ?
