&nbsp;
<div>My name is Marcelle Saab, MBO Partners&rsquo; new program manager responsible for interaction with our Associates and Alumni. I&rsquo;m happy to share with you that <a href="http://www.mbopartners.com/news-events/mbo-partners-unveils-comprehensive-program-power-independent-consulting-america">MBO Partners is launching a refreshed brand to the marketplace</a>.</div>
&nbsp;
<div>MBO Partners has been growing quickly. As businesses migrate to the new Project Economy with more and more work being procured on a contract basis, we have emerged as a leader in helping independent workers and their clients work together. As a result, we&rsquo;re compelled to enhance our messaging and demonstrate how MBO Partners is central to this growing trend.</div>
&nbsp;
<div><span style="color: black;">L</span>ast month, MBO Partners launched a new look and feel throughout our organization, including a new Web site (<u><a href="http://www.mbopartners.com/">www.mbopartners.com</a></u>) and refreshed branding. <span style="color: black;">Last </span>week we also launched a new-and-improved user interface for the online Business Center that&rsquo;s central to our Associate and client relationships.</div>
&nbsp;
<div>We hope you take a moment to explore the new site.</div>
&nbsp;
