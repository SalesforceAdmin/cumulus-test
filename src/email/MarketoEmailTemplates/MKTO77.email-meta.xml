I wanted to answer your specific question by preparing what we call a net cash estimate.  Enclosed you will find one that is purely an illustration.  I made a few guesses to your situation, I can customize this when I have more specific information for you. 
 
Here are a few assumptions I made:
·         160 hours
·         WA state
·         ~$500 in out of pocket expenses (medical/non-billable business) per month 
 
I look forward to discussing this over the phone in more detail.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
