I will wait to hear from Charlie directly once they have had a chance to review the information I sent over.  If I don’t hear something by Tuesday I will follow up with them to see where they are in the process.  Please let me know if you would like for me to do anything else at this point.
 
Thank you and have a great weekend,

Nicolette

Charlie,
 
I forwarded this to my business manager Nicolette and she is starting the process of working through it.
 
In order to keep this clean, I will make sure that my input on the contract goes to her and back to Parametrix.
 
Regards,
 
Darold

Darold – I left you a voicemail, but am following up with this email. I met with Jon this morning about our project. Cascade would like to move forward with the existing contract, as well as a new contract for the electrical engineering design work that is to be negotiated in the coming weeks. It is Cascade’s preference that we maintain the current roles, with Parametrix as prime and you working under our contract, either as an on-call employee or as a sub through MBO Partners. Jon made it clear that Cascade is not attempting to dictate the type of contract, but he did make it clear that your continued participation is expected. He also mentioned that a contract for SCADA design will be directly negotiated with you.
 
So for the near-term, I see your role as an on-call employee continuing. And as I mentioned in an earlier email, we would anticipate that we will use the Parametrix standard subconsultant PSA if you are interested in switching to a subconsultant role. (See attached. It currently shows Bellevue, but it may be a Puyallup contract. I’ll ask how it is to be handled and let you know.) If you or MBO Partners have any questions about the PSA, Jean Johnson is included on this email and you can contact her directly, or call me any time.

Talk to you soon.
Charlie
