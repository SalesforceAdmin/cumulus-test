We are sorry to see you go, but I personally wanted to share a few important pieces of information with you to help with the transition to alumni status. Should you have another potential project, we can easily re-activate your account. Pass It On, and Get Rewarded:  We appreciate your business, and wanted you to know that as an MBO alumni, you still qualify to earn a bonus for every successful Associate you refer to us. Please click here &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/referral-program&gt; to learn more about why many of our Associates refer us to peers, colleagues and friends. I hope we’ll see you again – and don’t forget that your next project opportunity can be run through MBO.  Once you secure the work, you can simply reply to this email and I’ll take it from there, so please keep it handy!  Please let me know if you have any further questions. We wish you well and I hope to hear from you soon.  Best wishes,Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
