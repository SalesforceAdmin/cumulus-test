Subject: RE: MBO Partners / Michael Rampolla Thank you, Sara and/or Nicolette!  Really appreciate the quick response and turn-around on the answers here and all of the other resources. At this point, I’m basically trying to evaluate the most cost-effective way to engage in this potential work agreement.  The pay rate that Johnson Controls (Client) is offering me is below what I had asked for – so any margins I can save / shave will be very helpful.   Based on that, I have three more questions:·         If I utilize MBO as my “middle-man” (not a negative term), does that mean I get to avoid the “paying myself” tax (LLC-associated, I think) which runs around 15%? With MBO the payroll tax comes out of your bill rate is and is remitted on our tax ID. This means you are responsible for business side of taxes the same as you would be if you were own your own as a 1099. If you let us know the rate the offered we can run a net cash estimate for you so you can see if it makes sense to run this work through MBO.  This will help you make a final business decision as to whether or not MBO is a fit.·         Are there any other “hidden” costs in creating an LLC business entity that I’m not considering?  (Does MBO have a side-by-side comparison of “Using MBO vs Creating an LLC”?) Likely yes. With MBO you know exactly what the taxes and fees are. With an LLC you may have filing fees, professional insurance fees, fees to pay a lawyer to review contracts, fees for a billing system to invoice your customer and follow up on payments, as well as fees you may pay an accountant to help you with your quarterly filings and expense deductions – just to name a few. Please take a look at this break down of MBO vs. 1099 &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_vs_1099_Comparison.pdf&gt;·         I’ve attached a “vendor agreement” that Johnson Controls (Client) sent my way.  Assuming that working with MBO “costs” me 5% vs. 15%, would you  be able to help me complete this document? Again the 5% is the fee for our service and professional insurance coverage; the taxes are the same as if you were on your own as a 1099. We would be able to help you the vendor agreement but I don’t see the attachment. Please send it again.  Thanks so much for all of your assistance!  Our pleasure! Regards,-Michael_______________________Michael RampollaMRampolla@gmail.com &lt;mailto:MRampolla@gmail.com&gt;262.271.5983linkedin.com/in/MRampolla From: Sara Conde [mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;]

Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Michael RampollaHi Nicolette -Actually, your timing is pretty good!  I have a meeting tomorrow (Monday Oct 14) with a very strong contender for my first &quot;real independent consultant&quot; contract!  (They don&apos;t know that, but that&apos;s just good consulting, right?  &quot;Look like you&apos;ve been there before.&quot;) – That’s great you’ve got the right approach! In any case:  If necessary, how quickly can I get set up with MBO?  - Within a day (assuming you can get to a notary), I will send you the online enrollment so you have it.  From what I know of this client -- Johnson Controls -- they prefer to work through &quot;vendor brokers&quot; -- hopefully, MBO is one of them?  Do you know? Unfortunately, we are not at this time but I am sure we would have no trouble meeting their credentials if they were willing to do business with us. If things move forward Nicolette can help you with the approach (she will be back on Wednesday) I am also happy to help as well if things move along sooner. What I&apos;m most interested in / concerned about is the Contract itself.  I&apos;ve been in discussions with them and have been working with a proposal that quotes both an hourly rate and two &quot;milestone&quot; rates (two-phase project).  But I definitely do not have any legal language or formal SOW content in the proposal -- in-scope, out-of-scope, provisions / guarantees, etc. We can help you with this; we have sample statements of work on our Independent’s Guide &lt;http://link.mbopartners.com/ol/0xEFfZmddHNcoUZ1%5Fu%2DNb%5Fmgz3iQN8jlq65yDbq2lMIt3kF6L7yJPEjr1YIDT8Z0dufDUUQVGpQ87T5ZF%5FCacIxB2vJQCki%2DFjjwjefPZokTIfJ2xNVz%5FvWI7ElXrPWsi2WeBUQ%2DdHJ0Sj6FfYYXiC7mB6F6clG%2DqFX1G40OkQ0cqJkHhryiLeOZzF712XDN9Q%2DDAUVQ7ujK0Gi%5FXqNOroYsm2w9xGQlZc7O%2DzjEz%2DUxmR4V%5F%2D4l2BdVw95mGcQx9yqxdHTh6bnhTPE7SLfgwbrx78sgbhRmuLcadGnlHHGDJqy6cSF%5Fwwa2rh8iGBg2IQRtBeUvtTaJv1h4RNI5Fze2yjEw%5FV58iPUfmM8%2C/1gwVMM7QNEZOogl76fOJI7v5kTDSadartLEyAPni198710x7fPjcdUb6gddUQ585cdaKDglNQYhU4SdiEMOQd65F6dBRAhWkcwLekq%2DPZIdqVLcm0dJ37vH1%5FHYL%2D9OvhUSdKmY7Z1htaDOaLOwEwW7Ddp0oSzyT9XCcZ58WvQMyj54y27ySaJWwriblp2Ll1RSfY1Zz7tu2xHapAo1%2Dou846hMJ%5FXsQSPPvygDg670pnCF%2Dpsgy3jg%2C&gt; which you can access by clicking here &lt;http://link.mbopartners.com/ol/0xEFfZmddHNcoUZ1%5Fu%2DNb%5Fmgz3iQN8jlq65yDbq2lMIt3kF6L7yJPEjr1YIDT8Z0dufDUUQVGpQ87T5ZF%5FCacIxB2vJQCki%2DFjjwjefPZokTIfJ2xNVz%5FvWI7ElXrPWsi2WeBUQ%2DdHJ0Sj6FfYYXiC7mB6F6clG%2DqFX1G40OkQ0cqJkHhryiLeOZzF712XDN9Q%2DDAUVQ7ujK0Gi%5FXqNOroYsm2w9xGQlZc7O%2DzjEz%2DUxmR4V%5F%2D4l2BdVw95mGcQx9yqxdHTh6bnhTPE7SLfgwbrx78sgbhRmuLcadGnlHHGDJqy6cSF%5Fwwa2rh8iGBg2IQRtBeUvtTaJv1h4RNI5Fze2yjEw%5FV58iPUfmM8%2C/1gwVMM7QNFhXs0g45v6WMqj%5FizvFaIvmuLNwRuX1ncI81gd3f%2D3IPVKgu%5FxmI6Y3aPmSABYVXYBlxlNVEfSqaI9Lp6dFPmCZYjHctqz0VphodeEmmZNH3JGEyTcCpNeYv3LmHEEaVEhUXVPPRKoLsgj0KbkWeCqG9k7GcNQH2Xss&gt;. Thanks in advance for your help!  If all goes well, hopefully I can stall them on paperwork and get in touch with you late morning.  (Nothing like giving you plenty of lead-time, right?!) Fingers crossed! I will send you an email to send to them to introduce MBO. Please be sure not to sign anything with them until MBO reviews the paperwork. Thanks in advance for your flexibility and assistance!
