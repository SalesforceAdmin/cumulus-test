First, thank you for joining us last month for our webinar, Is Independent Consulting Right For You? Now that you&apos;ve hopefully established that consulting is the right choice for you, we&apos;d like to invite you to join us as we explore three key questions to ask yourself. 


This conversation will be rich with questions, as well as real-life examples of independent consultants that have chosen this path. Led by Aassia Haq, CMO, MBO Partners and Sara Conde, Consultant Services Advisor, MBO Partners, we plan to help you understand your level of readiness for a solo career.
