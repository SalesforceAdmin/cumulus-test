    <textOnly>Dear Consultant,

Thank you for your using the MBO Partners Bill Rate Calculator and your request for more information.

The Bill Rate Calculator uses a cost-based pricing methodology. However, other strategies – market-based and value-based, for instance – may be worth exploring as well. Please click here [http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/How_To_Calculate_Your_Consulting_Rate.pdf] to read more about these strategies.

Furthermore, one of our Enrollment Managers can provide you a customized cash flow estimate showing you how taxes, expenses, and benefit deductions affect your net pay. You can call us Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET at 800-222-0469, or simply reply to this email and we will contact you.

Best regards,

MBO Partners
