Thanks for replying so quickly.
Although I am open to opportunities that come from PDC, I will continue working for my own clients. I would like MBO to run my billings.  I have some questions that I would like to ask you. 
Can we set a time when you can call me?  I can around around 1 pm or 2 pm. will that work for you.

Hi Danilo,
 
Thank you for your interest in MBO Partners.  Do you plan on working with Proposal Development Consultants again this year for your consulting work or have you found your own clients and you would like to run your billings through MBO for that work?
 
Please advise and if you have any additional questions for me please do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Thanks!
Nicolette
