    <textOnly>Registrants,

We are sorry to announce that todayâ€™s webinar was canceled due to a one-time technical issue. We have identified the problem so that it will not occur again.

Look out next week for a recording and slides on the topic, and email any additional questions about the 5 Consulting Trends webinar to jmacdonell@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:jmacdonell@mbopartners.com&gt;.
 
 Thank you for your patience and support of MBO Partners.
