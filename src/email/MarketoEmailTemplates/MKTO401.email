<body ><div style="font:14px tahoma; width:100%; " ><span class="mktEditable" id="edit_text" ><div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: georgia,palatino;">We have launched a new phase of our State of Independence Initiative with an exciting, human view of independence in America titled: <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/meet-the-independents.html">Meet the Independents</a>!</span></div>
&nbsp;
<div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: georgia,palatino;">For the past two months, we have been busy identifying, interviewing, and photographing independent workers across the country to move toward our vision of showcasing an independent professional in every state.</span></div>
&nbsp;
<div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: georgia,palatino;">You may enjoy viewing the stories of independent workers across our nation; including <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/meet-the-independents-co.html">Jesse Jacoby</a>, <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/meet-the-independents-ca.html">Bryan Forman</a>, <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/meet-the-independents-md.html">Gloria Parker</a>, <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/meet-the-independents-va.html">Ward Mannering</a>, and <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/meet-the-independents-ga.html">Susan Bernstein</a>.</span></div>
&nbsp;
<div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: georgia,palatino;">Do you know someone who should be showcased? Please share their name with us, so that we may invite them to participate.</span></div>
&nbsp;
<div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: georgia,palatino;">In Sept 2011, our <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/age-of-independence.html">inaugural independent workforce study</a> showed 16 million have already joined the ranks of independent work, growing to 20 million by 2023.</span></div>
&nbsp;
<div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: georgia,palatino;">And this December, our CEO Gene Zaino will predict that by the close of the decade, we will witness an independent majority. To follow updates from Gene&rsquo;s speech and insights while he and our team present at GigaOM&rsquo;s &ldquo;Net:WORK&rdquo; conference, follow @mbopartners or @genezaino on Twitter, or view the live video stream online at <a href="http://event.gigaom.com/network/video/">http://event.gigaom.com/network/video/</a>.</span></div>
&nbsp;
<div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: georgia,palatino;">Please help us meet a new independent &ndash; and we welcome your thoughts on the evolution of our journey.</span></div>
&nbsp;
<div><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: georgia,palatino;">Thank you!</span></div>
