In the United States, nearly every business uses contract or contingent labor in some way or other. Non-employee labor is the fastest growing segment of the workforce today and Human Resources cannot expect other parts of the organization to take the same level of concern about policies, laws, security and talent quality. Organizations are using Managed Services Providers (MSPs), Vendor Management Systems (VMS), and Independent Contractor Engagement Compliance Services (ICES) to protect them from the various risk points, but if they do not take the proper precautions there is still significant exposure.

Co-employment lawsuits, misclassification penalties, wage and hour class actions and other legal concerns need constant governance and regulations at the Department of Labor and the IRS are broad enough that there could still be a lack of clarity and serious risks going unnoticed. Come hear the perspectives of esteemed labor lawyers Eric Rumbaugh, Esq. of Michael Best &amp; Friedrich and Suellen Oswald of Littler Mendelson on this topic and learn where organizations could be vulnerable and how to prevent disaster.
