Just review this contract because if they refuse to let us sign they would want you to sign this. At least, that is my understanding especially since they already have a PDF attached with signatures. It has the right rate but only 30 days written notice for termination. Based on Patricks email I doubt that they are going to do a six month notification but I will push.
 
Anyhow just wanted you to be familiar with this document in case you end up having to sign it as a last resort.
 
Thanks!

Dear Val and Patrick, 
 
My name is Sara Conde and I work with Jake here at MBO Partners. On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with you and your organization.  I have reviewed the agreement and enclosed the revised version with our information.  I have included a copy that lists our changes as well as a clean copy should you accept them for your counter signature. 
 
Here are the list of changes and explination for each one:
 
 
Descriptoin of services - Due to our role as an employer or record for tax purposes and not that of a staffing agency we can not attest to the level of skill.  
Term - We prefer 120 days (6 months) written notice from IFAW.  
·         Fee -  The fee is $75 per hour at 35 hours per week. Thus, the budget was updated to reflect this.
 
If you are curious about MBO Partners and what we do and how we work, we have a short one page overview that may answer some of your questions, which you may access by going here.
I look forward to working with you,  
 
Best regards,
 
Sara

Dear Val and Patrick,
The reason why I requested an electronic version of the contract to review was because I wanted to review it and introduce you to Steve Arhancet at MBO Partners.  MBO Partners handles tax, expense, benefit, payment and contract management for independent consultants.  Steve is my contact at MBO Partners that manages my various contracts.  I wanted to send a brief introduction as a couple changes in the contract will be needed.  His information is below and will be following up shortly.  If interested more information can be found at www.mbopartners.com 

Thanks,
Jake
