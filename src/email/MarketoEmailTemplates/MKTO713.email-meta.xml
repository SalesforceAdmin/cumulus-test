You are very welcome. Time and billable expenses to the client from as far back as November will not be an issue. However,  we will only allow non-billable expenses (which will lower your taxable income) that are incurred after your start date with us.
 
Please me know if you have any additional questions.
 
Take care!

Thank you Sara, hopefully I will complete this today. I have hours and expenses that need to billed going back as far as November. Will that be a problem?
