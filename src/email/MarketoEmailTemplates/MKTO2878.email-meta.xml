Anne would like to run her project through MBO and since we already have a master service agreement in place all we would need is for you to complete and sign this statement of work &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_SOW.pdf&gt; for Anne so we have all the information needed to bill.  Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to continuing our relationship with you. Best,
Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!
