    <subject>Breakfast Workshop for Consultants - Are you able to attend?</subject>
    <textOnly>{{lead.First Name:default=Consultant}},

We&apos;d like to notify you of a breakfast workshop for consultants in Tyson’s Corner on March 13th.

It’s called “Same Rain, Bigger Drops” and is based on an extremely popular speech given at Consulting Magazine’s Consulting Summit a few weeks ago.

The breakfast workshop is free, and includes breakfast at the Ritz Carlton. (Well, almost free. To register, you’re asked to donate $30 to Make-A-Wish, which is less than the cost of breakfast at the Ritz!). You can register at this link: http://nynen.com/biggerdrops-va &lt;http://nynen.com/biggerdrops-va&gt;

If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email!
