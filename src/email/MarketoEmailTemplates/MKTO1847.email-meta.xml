So to clarify, either way, we still need to create an invoice in our system, meaning you will still need to enter your hours in our time keeping system. Thanks,Sara From: Sara Conde

I need to receive the invoices directly from Max. I will then get the invoices approved and send you a check.
Thank you.

Best Regards,

Payment $1,125 is for July 9th -15th for a total of 22.5 hours.  I will be sending you revised invoices that reflect the $50 per hour rate. The last invoice you will receive from Max will be for time through July 20th (MBO will also invoice this for your records.) From July 20th and on all invoices will come directly from MBO only. 
Thank you!Sara From: Sara Conde

Importance: High Hi Irena, We received two payments today from Calvin today, thank you! I wanted to follow up on the remittance so I can get corrected invoices out to you at the proper rate and time line for your accounting records and so that we can apply the funds properly in our system as well.  Can you please provide me with remittance information for these payments? 
·         $4,625
·         $1,125 As, I understand it the rate is $50 per hour, please confirm. As soon as I have confirmation I will send you corrected invoices and apply funds in our system. Moving forward, MBO invoices will replace the ones Max has been sending you to cut down on confusion and streamline the process. 
Thank you,Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028 &lt;tel:703.793.6028&gt;f: 703.793.6068 &lt;tel:703.793.6068&gt;e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
