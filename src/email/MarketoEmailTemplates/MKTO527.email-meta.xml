Be sure to follow the example of the I9 on the page before the actual I9. If the signatures are in the wrong spot, I have to get you to re-do it – which can be a pain. 
 
Regards,

We carry comprehensive business insurances, including General Liability, Errors and Omissions, and Workers’ Compensations policies that all our Associates are covered under.
