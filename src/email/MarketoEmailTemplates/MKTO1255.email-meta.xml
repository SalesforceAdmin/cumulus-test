Subject: Re: MBO Partners Inquiry Right now I&apos;m working a short term contract for Intuit.  I do want to look into incorporating and continuing my contracting work and wanted to get an idea of what services you provide and the costs.  I&apos;m trying to figure out how much I want to do myself vs. just focusing on the work itself. I&apos;ve been a little busy as it&apos;s tax season, and I&apos;m helping out Intuit&apos;s Turbo Tax app, but after the 18th I should have more time to invest in this. From: Nicolette Taylor &lt;ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:ntaylor@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt;

Subject: FW: MBO Partners Inquiry Dear Andrew,  Some time ago you requested information regarding the services offered by MBO Partners.  Now might not be the right time for you.  Whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America. I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation. Are you working on a contract/project now or are you currently working W2 at the moment? Regards, Nicolette ___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
