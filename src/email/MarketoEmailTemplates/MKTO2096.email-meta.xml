UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CHANGES
Earlier last month, the unemployment rates for several states were adjusted.  The driving force for the majority of these changes was the increase in unemployment across the US. More than 20 states were forced to borrow money from the federal Unemployment Insurance trust fund to pay benefits which translates to higher Unemployment Insurance tax rates.  Learn more &gt; &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/employers--prepare-for-these-tax-hikes-in-2012/2011/12/27/gIQAFjbeUP_story.html?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRow5%2FmYJoDpwmWGd5mht7VzDtPj1OY6hBkqIruJK1TtuMFUGpsqOOScDg%3D%3D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&gt;

HR CLUING IN TO DEALING WITH INDEPENDENT WORKERS
HR organizations are very focused on the full-time employee segment of their business because that&apos;s what they do, which means they typically don&apos;t deal with non-employees. Now the more forward-thinking companies have decided to partner HR and procurement to figure out how to handle independent workers. Read more about WebWorkerDaily&apos;s interview with Gene Zaino on how HR is cluing in on dealing with the Independents. more &gt; &lt;http://gigaom.com/collaboration/corporations-no-longer-clueless-about-independent-work/?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRow5%2FmYJoDpwmWGd5mht7VzDtPj1OY6hBkqIruJK1TtuMFUGpsqOOScDg%3D%3D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&gt;

CEO CORNER
IT&apos;S ALL ABOUT REFERRALS
In business, one of the most important metrics for success is a strong customer referral. And in the consulting business it is absolutely critical. In a recent survey of MBO Partners Associates, we found that nearly 90% of all new business comes from a referral. It can be a former employer, a colleague, or previous client. Referrals are by far the most cost-effective way to build your client base and it is a reflection that you are a trusted advisor who delivers value.  more &gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/CEOCorner03.01.12.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&gt;
CTO CORNER
TABLET COMPUTERS: WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR BIZ?
There&apos;s a lot of press around about tablet computers and plenty of articles about choosing the right one for you (the short answer: it depends…). However, before we ask which one to buy, perhaps a more important question is: why do you want or need one? Instead of just reiterating what&apos;s in several publications, I&apos;d like to give you a perspective based on my own experience as well as people I know who use tablets regularly. more &gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/CTOCorner03.01.12.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&gt;</textOnly>
