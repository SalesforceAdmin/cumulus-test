As promised, I wanted to follow up with you from our last communication.  Is there someone that might be best for me to speak with about our services at this time?

Steve

Raj,
 
Hello, my name is Steve Arhancet.  I work at MBO Partners and I received your contact information from Amber Johnson one of the CSR’s that works here in our Herndon office.  She mentioned you may be interested in learning more about our services.  We commonly partner with consulting firms that use 1099 consultants and share some similar markets based off the information from your site (which I might mention is a wonderful website).  You can easily schedule time convenient for you in my online calendar by going here https://my.timedriver.com/C9CPC or if you prefer to provide me a date and time to reach you I can call you then.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
