Thank you for your interest.  We don’t actually assist you in finding your next contract (aside from just general marketing advice); however we are definitely the best way to engage once you find a contract to work on.  Should something materialize and you find your next contract, that’s a great time to reach back out to me and I can assist with the paperwork and on-boarding for it.
 
Regards,
 
Steve

Steve,
Indeed, I would definitely be interested in Consulting.
And even more importantly, I would be interested in working with you. Please let me know what positions that you may have available.
 
In addition to having my PMP certification, I have attained CCE Certification from the AACE organization and generally am regarded as an &quot;expert&quot; in the Project Controls field.
In fact, I frequently teach the Project Controls and Risk Management classes for the local AACE and PMI organizations in the cities that I am assigned.
 
Since I have recently completed an assignment, I am now available and would look forward to discussing employment opportunities with you.,
 
Please advise.
 
Thanks,
 
F Sam Griggs, PMP, CCE

Dear Fred,
Along the way, you shared with us that you have considered independent consulting as a career path. We appreciate your interest in our company and the topic of independence. It&apos;s a subject we are passionate about.
Each year, we observe a surge in interest around the topic just after the holidays from connections new and old. You may be interested in participating in our pre-New-Years Webinar:
Title: Is Independent Consulting Right For You?
Date/Time: Tomorrow, 12/30, at 12:30 PM EST
Or just reading about our point of view in a recent posting we did.
Steve
