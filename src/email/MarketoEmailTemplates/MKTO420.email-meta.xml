I have not yet heard back from Sherry since the initial email she sent to which I responded with the contract changes.  I will wait until tomorrow and try again.  
 
I would be happy to try and reach her by phone also if I don’t hear from her by tomorrow.
 
In regards for the work you have already done and continue to do, you are working at risk until we get the contract in place but it is no problem to bill the hours to the client once we get the contract in place as long as they agree to pay them.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions about this.
 
Thank you,
 
Nicolette

Ok, I will and keep me up-to-date on any progress. I am and have been doing work for them so I hope that won&apos;t be a problem billing for hours over the last few weeks. Thanks.  --Larry

Hi Larry, 
 
She reached out to me by email yesterday evening and I re-forwarded my initial email to her.  Please let me know if you hear from her that she still did not receive it.
 
Thank you,

Hi Larry,
 
I forwarded her my comments on the agreement originally on 11/21 (which I copied you on) and I forwarded her the email again last week on 11/29.  Both had the agreement attached, marked with changes and my comments in the body of the email.  Please let me know if she did not receive them and also make sure she checks her junk folder as it may have gotten caught in a spam filter for some reason.
 
Please let me know if she still did not receive them and I can forward the email again.
 
Thanks!

That is correct, they have not replied to either of my emails, even to let me know that they are in the process of reviewing.  Am I sending it to the proper email addresses: &apos;sslaughter@biosoteria.com&apos; and &apos;svandoren@biosoteria.com&apos;?
 
Please advise.

Yes agreed, I don&apos;t want to be too pushy either as I have a longstanding professional relationship with their prinicipals. So it appears then that they haven&apos;t commented on any of the changes MBO has proposed then?

Hi Larry,
 
I still haven’t heard anything from BioSoteria so you may want to reach out to them to give them a nudge and I can follow up again next week.  I didn’t want to be too pushy since I have yet to “meet” them.  Let me know how you would like me to proceed.
 
Have a great weekend!
Nicolette

Hi Larry,
 
I am glad to hear you decided to move forward with MBO.  I will review the contract and send it over to my contracts team for their sign off and get it back to you by sometime Monday.  In the meantime, please feel free to introduce me to the clients and let them know I will be sending the contract back to them with any proposed changes and we can go from there.  If you have any additional questions please let me know.
 
We do provide Business Cards but not until you have been activate with us through your first few payrolls.  At that point, once you are sure you are going to continue your relationship with us then we can order them for you but they would be at your cost.  Let me know if you have questions about this as well.
 
Do not hesitate to reach out to me for any clarification and I look forward to working with you!
 
Have a great weekend,
Nicolette

Nicolette, I wanted to give you a heads up that I would like to move forward with MBO Partners as my employer of record. My first consulting agreement will be with BioSoteria and I have attached their standard consulting agreement template (I&apos;m not able to open it [maybe you can] so I&apos;m trying to get a version that I can). I am still considering what I want to ask for in terms of my billing rate, but wanted to get things moving with you.
 
Shall I put the appropriate individuals at BioSoteria in touch directly with you? Let me know next steps Nicolette and thanks again for all your help.  By the way, do you provide any assistance with business cards? Thanks.--Larry
