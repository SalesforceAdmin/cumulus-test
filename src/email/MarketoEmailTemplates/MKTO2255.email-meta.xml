HOW TO GIVE POWERFUL PRESENTATIONS
The ability to communicate is one of the most powerful weapons in your professional arsenal. Communicating comes in many different forms, from professional writing &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide/succeed/business-writing-tips&gt;, to networking conversations &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/common-sense-networking-tips-independent-consultants-and-contractors-1&gt; to presentations. Many of us fear public speaking, and the rest of us generally do not enjoy it. Essentially, a presentation is simply communicating your ideas to your audience. Whether you are presenting to a potential client, a keynote audience, or an existing client, it is essential to be able to deliver a message clearly, succinctly and effectively.

Most of us have sat through a bad presentation – from an overlong presentation to 
cringe-worthy slides. The messages may have been important, but they were most likely lost or diluted because of a poor delivery. Presentations affect professional reputation &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/building-personal-brand-and-why-it-matters&gt;, so the ability to effectively communicate ideas is vital to the strength of any independent consultancy.

TESTIMONIAL
“When I started independent work, I was worried about my family and how I would be able to provide my wife, daughter, and newborn son with the medical coverage that I had provided so easily before in my salaried jobs. I was very thankful to have had the opportunity to learn about what MBO had to offer me. My family and I are grateful that we have medical benefits without the restrictions or requirements of non-group insurance.&quot;
