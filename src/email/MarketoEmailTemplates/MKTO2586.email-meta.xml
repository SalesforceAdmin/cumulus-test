    <subject>MBO Partners Independent Consulting Brief - April 2013</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
Coming from the Enterprise Solutions side of MBO Partners, I meet with a lot of executives who use independent contract talent. To fit the definition of a compliant and qualified contractor, any IC they use needs to exhibit certain characteristics. They must see themselves as businesses of one and be accountable for the work they sign up for. Independent-minded solopreneurs looking to find their own work will have an edge in this competitive marketplace. To win big contracts and gain the trust of executives, being able to present effectively is a core requirement. Please check out our guide on powerful presentations &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide/succeed/how-to-give-powerful-presentations&gt;, and keep a lookout for materials from our webinar on that same topic coming early next week.

HOW TO GIVE POWERFUL PRESENTATIONS
The ability to communicate is one of the most powerful weapons in your professional arsenal. Communicating comes in many different forms, from professional writing, to networking conversations to presentations. Many of us fear public speaking, and those of us who do not generally do not enjoy it.  Essentially, a presentation is simply communicating your ideas to your audience. Whether you are presenting to a potential client, a keynote audience, or an existing client, it is essential to be able to deliver a message clearly, succinctly and effectively.

Most of us have sat through a bad presentation – from an overlong presentation to cringe-worthy slides. The messages may have been important, but they were most likely lost or diluted because of a poor delivery. Presentations affect professional reputation, so the ability to effectively communicate ideas is vital to the strength of any independent consultancy.
