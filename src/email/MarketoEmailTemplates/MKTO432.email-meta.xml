Enclosed is the contract that we would send to the client (assuming they don’t send us an agreement).  MBO MSA 11-30-10.docEnclosed is the agreement that is signed between MBO and the workers that you send over (this is signed online when they enroll in our system). Illustration of $75.00 an hour in TN 
Next Steps:
 
·         Click the link in the previous email to enroll online and set-up your team center; at the end of that process follow the instructions for completing the I9 form and fax the completed form back to me.
·         Introduce me to the point of contact at the client so we can complete all the paperwork. 
·         Introduce me to the worker once you have finalized the rate and scope of services; so that I can get them set-up and attached to your team center. 
 
I will follow up with you as promised, if you have questions before then, feel free to schedule a convenient time using my online schedule: https://my.timedriver.com/C9CPC.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
