Hi Ananth,
 
I hope all is well with you!  It has been a few months since we last spoke and I wanted to follow up with you to see if you still planned on using MBO for your consulting projects?  The last time we spoke I had sent a contract to your client and they never followed up with me so I wanted to find out the status of this project or any others that you may have coming up.
 
Please provide me with an update and I look forward to hearing from you!
Nicolette
