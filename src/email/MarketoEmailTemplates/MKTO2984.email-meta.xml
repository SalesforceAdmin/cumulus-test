SCOPING OUT THE STATEMENT OF WORK
Successful project management is critical for independent consultants. You have to properly set client expectations up front and deftly manage the project to ensure that those expectations are met. However, it is not uncommon for issues to arise after a project starts. Little requests that were not originally discussed over time can add up to the dreaded “scope creep.”

A good statement of work or scope of work document is a channel that opens up communication between you and your client. As you work to create the document, you can and should explore the boundaries of the project, including what will be done and what is outside of the scope of the agreement. A scope of work document is essentially a blueprint for your project, so it should include overall goals of the project, milestones, and even payment terms.

ENJOYING THE HOLIDAYS WITHOUT LOSING YOUR CONTRACTS

As the conversations in your neighborhood turn to turkey, mistletoe and eggnog, you’ll inevitably hear people comparing vacation time. Some companies are generous, and some can be Scrooge-like. However, as an independent, no one tells you when to vacation; you just have to figure it out.


Your clients will be thinking about their own holiday stressors— they all have in-laws coming to town, too. However, they’ll still be expecting their deliverables when they return (contract documents aren’t known to celebrate any major holidays). So how can independent consultants know when to start booking their vacation without losing valuable business?

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. How does MBO change the way I file my taxes?

A. MBO can run your tax deductions as you pay yourself and withhold the appropriate taxes for you. No more quarterlies! When you conduct business in multiple states, we’ll take care of withholding the appropriate amounts based on the requirements of the states. We also bring you in compliance with the many local tax subtleties, including sales taxes.

MBO will also keep track of expenses and provide you with a tax benefit for each qualified expense you would otherwise have to itemize at the end of the year. This eliminates the need to keep that “shoe box” of receipts all year long.

TESTIMONIAL
The retirement benefits and the simplicity of being on payroll instead of having to make quarterly tax payments are also aspects of MBO that I have really come to appreciate as I&apos;ve learned more about the company.The web site is very user-friendly and complete with information and explanations for helping me run my business.
