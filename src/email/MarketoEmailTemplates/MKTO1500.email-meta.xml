Would you mind calling me? In the meantime your time has been approved an it invoiced this afternoon since it was the end of the month. 
The email below is only an automatic notification from our system to let you know  you had time that was still not approved. I had not approved it yet because it was not the end of the month so you can disregard. Please give me a ring.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
