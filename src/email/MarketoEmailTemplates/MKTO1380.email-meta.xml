Subject: RE: prenote rejection for Dorothy Beattie (20670) Hello Sara
I have updated the bank info.
Somehow it was entered with an account that included the ABA#... Anyway- it should work now.
 
This is a local bank and they watch the accounts like a hawk- so they may STILL reject it unless I phone them... let me know.
 
Thanks
Dorothy
 
PS- How long does Dorado usually take to PAY an invoice- do you know?

Subject: FW: prenote rejection for Dorothy Beattie (20670)Hi Dorothy, The bank account number we have on file for your account was rejected by the bank. Can you log in and update it by clicking on “payments” (top grey menu) and then “direct deposit” (left menu bar.) Please let me know if you have any questions.
