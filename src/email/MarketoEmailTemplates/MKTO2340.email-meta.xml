WRITING AND DELIVERING PROPOSALS: THE GUIDE TO SUCCESS
pro·pos·al [pruh-poh-zuhl] noun:  the act of offering or suggesting something for acceptance, adopting or performance.


A Chinese philosopher wisely once said, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” For consultants and small firms, that step is often writing a proposal. As an independent consultant, you will inevitably hear the words, “send me a proposal.” However, the real results come in mastering the details of how and when to deliver yours to a potential client.


Many professionals make the mistake of equating proposal activity with sales activity. Proposal development is not a give-away activity, but rather a strategic tool to gain business. It is far better to deliver one proposal a month that gains business than to develop five without a single win.


Like resumes, winning proposals &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/webinar-wrap-four-keys-writing-successful-proposal&gt; must be grammatically corrected, spell-checked and visually appealing. But more importantly, they must specifically address your prospect’s needs and offer a clear solution tailored to your potential client. And also like resumes, the real work of your proposal happens before you ever begin writing &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide/succeed/business-writing-tips&gt; it.

Nicolette Taylor, a consultant services advisor for MBO Partners, tells the story of a longtime military man who found consulting as a way to contribute post-retirement.   

“Retirement doesn’t have to be the end. I talk to retirees often that still want to use their skills, but may be burned out from a long career. What MBO offers them is an avenue to keep working without getting hung up on energy-wasting back office work.”
