Subject: Re: MBO Partners / David Jara Hi Nicolette,  Thanks for reaching out. These resources are very useful. I am in the midst of reviewing a few opportunities and should be working soon. In terms of feedback, one resource that I think might be good is how to introduce MBO to clients that currently do not have a contract with them. It is hard enough to to secure a contract personally, let alone introduce another player like MBO. For most companies, new vendors bring in lots of red tape that most are averse too without demonstrating clear value. Selling yourself, as well as MBO can be quite challenging. Another resource that we talked about is a list of companies that MBO already has relationships with. This would make it easier to target specific companies. I hope this is helpful.  Regards,  Dave  On Fri, Jul 20, 2012 at 12:32 PM, Nicolette Taylor &lt;ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:ntaylor@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:
