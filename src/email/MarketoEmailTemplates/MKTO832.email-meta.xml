Thank you for completing the online enrollment process. I have received your I-9 – thank you! Unfortunately, the image of your passport came through distorted via fax. Can you send me a picture of it via email? (most people just take a picture of it with their smart phone.) 
 
Yes, I spoke to Matt Small, who is Mike’s contact at MBO and he said he would keep me in the loop on the contract as well. As soon as I have an update on the contract, billing frequency, and net terms I will let you know. I believe MBO is still waiting on receiving the contract from Weather.com. 
 
The fee is not listed by % in our contract. You are correct, the fee is 5% off the top for the first 125k in received billings. After that, it drops to 1.5% and will reset to 5% each anniversary year.
 
Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thank you,
Sara

Hi Sara,
I completed the enrollment process and will fax in the i-9 tomorrow.  I also talked to Mike Buchkovsky on Friday and he said he&apos;d call you to discuss how the contract/billing would work for this engagement that I&apos;m doing with him for weather.com.  Let me know if you need anything else from me regarding that.
Also, I noticed that the contract I signed makes mention to MBO fees but I didn&apos;t actually see the fee amount you detailed on Friday, 5% for the first 125K then 1.25% for everything additional (I believe that was right).  Will I have another contract to sign to agree to those amounts?
 
Thanks,
Brian
