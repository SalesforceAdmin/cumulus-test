Hi Mike,
 
Hope you are doing well. Just wanted to follow up with you  did you end up working with Crescent as a W-2?
 
Take care,
Sara

Hi Mike,

So nice speaking with you!  To summarize our call you are going to go back to crescent to confirm if the $70 per hour that they would offer  you outside of our program is corp to corp (1099) or if it is W-2. If its $70 on a W-2 you should go with their payroll option. If its $70 on a 1099 our program would be of benefit to you and we can create a financial snap shot and go into the service offerings in greater detail.
 
Looking forward to hear what they come back with!
 
Take care,
Sara
