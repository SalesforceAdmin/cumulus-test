On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with your firm. MBO Partners caters to two markets.  Our first service is designed for independent consultants and  small businsses &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/#howwehelp&gt; who choose to plug into our MBO Services Cloud to make it easier for them to work with their clients.  We take care of all the back office administrative, HR, regulatory and financial issues so they can stay focused on delivering on their services.  The second is how we help enterprise organizations engage more efficently and safely with their contract workforce &lt;http://www.mboenterprise.com/how-we-help&gt;.  We have also put together a short one page collateral &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Introduction.pdf&gt; that explains how we work and the markets we serve. The following links provide our standard agreement &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_MSA_Template.pdf&gt; and statement of work &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_SOW.pdf&gt;  we use when engaging our Associates with their clients.  Please review and complete it, and return a signed copy to me. And, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thanks again, and I look forward to working with you.   Best regards,Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Butterball Contract contact Hey Ron, meet Sara.  She’s my MBO Partners business manager and she’ll be working with me to get all my clients set up. Sara, meet Ron.  He’ll be the one who signs all the contracts.  I’m sorry I don’t have his phone number but he’s never there and always in meetings anyway so you’ll have better luck with email. Please let me know if you have any questions, etc.  Thanks and I look forward to a long mutual relationship. Karl Bradshawe-mail: kbradshaw@coralparkgroup.com &lt;mailto:kbradshaw@coralparkgroup.com&gt;Work: (704) 243-2963Cell: (704) 577-0950 The often ignored crazy old guy in the corner who mutters to himself in riddles of logic while drawing arcane symbols on a glowing tablet – thus weaving the spells of technology.  Confidentiality Note: This e-mail, and any attachment to it, contains privileged and confidential information intended only for the use of the individual(s) or entity named on the e-mail.
