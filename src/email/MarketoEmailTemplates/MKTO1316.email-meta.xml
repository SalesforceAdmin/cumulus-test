It means a lot to have the face to face connection, not enough people realize that these days. I will check out Omi Partners and let you know my impressions. I have just reached out to the e MBO Access program manager so she can get you set up with any account. Good luck in your search (keeping my fingers crossed!!!)Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
