Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Jane Meyer Sara, Thanks for checking in.  I was able to pick-up several consulting assignments that are keeping me busy.  I will wrap-up a couple of assignments in the next two weeks.  I would like to reconnect if you are open to talking about my path forward.  The best time for me is next week after Tuesday.  Is there a good day and time that works for you. Thanks,Jane From: Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt;
