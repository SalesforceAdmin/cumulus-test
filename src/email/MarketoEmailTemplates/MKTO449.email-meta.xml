    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

It’s been some time since we last spoke with you, but I personally wanted to check in and share some news with you. We recently launched a new consultant-focused Web site (www.mbopartners.com) which includes relevant tools such as a Bill Rate Calculator (http://www.mbopartners.com/#billrate), a self-assessment tool on independence (http://www.mbopartners.com/#rightforyou), and a video that shows how we help independents succeed (http://www.mbopartners.com/#howwehelp) in today’s project economy. We encourage you to take a look.

Whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America (http://info.mbopartners.com/the-state-of-independence.html). I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation (http://info.mbopartners.com/who-are-the-independents.html).

Please feel free to reply to this email and provide an update on how your contract search is going. Are you working on a project now or you currently working W2 at the moment?
