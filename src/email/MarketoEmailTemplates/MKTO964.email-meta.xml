Will you send me the proposal on a plan word document ASAP so I may place it on our letterhead as requested by the Tower Company?
 
Thank you!

Subject: RE: contract agreements
 
Dear Steve, 
 
On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with you and your organization.  I have reviewed the agreement and enclosed the revised version with our information.  I have included a copy that lists our changes attached.  
 
Here are the list of changes and explination for each one:
 
Entire Agreement –needs to be between Tower Companies and MBO Partners, Inc.  
Section 4 – Payment terms – we prefer payment terms of net 30 days as this is industry standard.  
Section 17 – Warranty -   Due to our role as an employer or record for tax purposes and not that of a staffing agency we can not agree to this warrenty. We can agree that work will be done in a professional workmen like manner.  
Section 10 Termination – We need the ability to cancel an engagement if we receive the intent to resign from the assigned consultant and we prefer 15 days written notice as this is industry standard.  
Section 18a - Indemnity - We prefer to use our standard indemnity language.  
Exhibit A – We will place this on MBO letterhead to be consistant with the contract and send over.  Also, we ask that you complete and add the attached SOW to the agreement.  
We need these same chagnes in each agreement for each buliding. 
 
If you are curious about MBO Partners and what we do and how we work, we have a short one page overview that may answer some of your questions, which you may access by going here.
I look forward to working with you,  
 
Best regards,
 
Sara

Good morning 
 
I have attached the contracts agreements.  Please print (2) copies of each, sign and return to us by US mail and email, as soon as possible.
 
As soon as we receive same, we will submit them to our legal department for our owners signatures.  Then we will return a copy with original signatures to you.
 
And a reminder we will need the copy of the COI (instructions attached) for each building and the W-9 .
 
Please let me know, if you have any questions.
 
Thank you
