Our Expense Team let me know there are a few issues with your expenses so I wanted to go through them for you: ·         “Brighthouse” internet service on 5.23 and 6.23 needs a receipt uploaded to the expense in order for our team to approve. If they send you any kind of bill or statement via email you can print that to a .pdf and upload it right to the file. If they send you a paper bill you can take a picture of that with your phone and upload the file that way.  If you click on the expense you will notice a “upload receipt” button in the lower left corner.·         Mileage on 6.12, 6.18, and 6.25 needs an origin and destination address. If you click on the expense you can update these fields. We need the full address (not just the name of the city.) ·         Sprint phone bill on 6.20 you can only expense the amount associated with your business line. You have put the full amount of the bill which lists 3 numbers. You will also need to provide a receipt for this bill (most people just pull the .pdf statement from the providers website.) If you would like to walk through this updates together via phone I am more than happy to assist you. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
