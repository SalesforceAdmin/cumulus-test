I created the first invoice for you (using the attachments you had sent to Calving group.) I used the hours and the notes, but I did not have a rate. I asked you for the rate and you let me know it was $65 and Calvin is saying it is $50. I need to know the rate so our invoices can match what their payment is going to be. It is very easy for you to generate invoices in our system; all you need to do is enter the number of hours. If you want to put a note it for the time the hours covered (as you do on your invoices) you can do that as well by entering a “note.” I would like to review this with you via phone.  Moving forward, PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY MORE INVOICES TO CALIVN GROUP, simply enter your hours in MBO and we will invoice and Calvin will make payment on our invoice. Please send me any invoices you have sent to Calvin group to-date that you are running through MBO so I can figure out how to get these funds applied property.
I need to get these funds applied today to get you on payroll so please consider this urgent.  Please call me when you get this. Thanks,Sara From: Max Katz [mailto:max.katz.work@gmail.com]

Subject: Re: Payments to Max Katz Sara,  I don&apos;t understand what this invoice is on about.  I&apos;m invoicing the client directly.   Please call me today if you still have not received a check from the client after mail is delivered.         -Max On Mon, Jul 23, 2012 at 9:09 AM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Hi Max, Ok, so to confirm: 
·         We should revise our invoice to $50 per hour instead of $65 and resend (as Irena has requested.) 
·         Would you like me to reach out to Irena about the payment? I thought it was best that you did (which is why I provided the wire and payment information in my other email) as I did not want to cause and trouble that might make her change her mind about remitting payment to us. If you would like me to work with her directly that is fine, I just need to know. Otherwise I will continue you communicate with you and you can pass along the information to Irena.  Please confirm these items. Thanks,
