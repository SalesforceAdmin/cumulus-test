You can make changes to your benefits selections up to 30 days after your start date with MBO via your online account. After that period the only change that can be made is with a qualifying event (job loss, loss of coverage, divorce etc.) or during our open enrollment period. We hold open enrollment in December for benefits starting January 1, 2013. You can change the retirement funding at any time via your online account, there is no restriction.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
Have a great night!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: MBO Partners / Thomas Erickson Sara  you must be reading my mind!  I left a message on your office voice mail not 30 minutes ago.  I am completing the MBO Partners enrollment online and was wondering whether MBO Partners allows changes only during an annual open enrollment period, and if so when that might next occur. Please give me a when you get the chance.  I will look forwarding to catching up with you. Tom Erickson, MSEM, P.E., PgMPAn Enterprise AgilistC: 703.201.0021E: terickson@apnbok.comL: www.linkedin.com/in/tcerickson  From: Sara Conde [mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com] &lt;mailto:tom.erickson@computer.org&gt;

Hello Thomas,
I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?
Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
	- There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one:

           http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-webcast-index &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPXByb2QtbC0xMzYmbWVzc2FnZWlkPTEzNiZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEzMjY4NTM5MzQmc2VyaWFsPTEyNjQ3MTkzNDMmZW1haWxpZD10ZXJpY2tzb25AYXBuYm9rLmNvbSZ1c2VyaWQ9bC0xMjgtMTE3OTctMTE0MzM5NyZleHRyYT0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-webcast-index?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvKjNZKXonjHpfsX56uguWq6xlMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ATsBrI%2FqLAzICFpZo2FFVGO8%3D&gt;
	- MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, theres real hard facts about The State of Independence in America &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPXByb2QtbC0xMzYmbWVzc2FnZWlkPTEzNiZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEzMjY4NTM5MzQmc2VyaWFsPTEyNjQ3MTkzNDMmZW1haWxpZD10ZXJpY2tzb25AYXBuYm9rLmNvbSZ1c2VyaWQ9bC0xMjgtMTE3OTctMTE0MzM5NyZleHRyYT0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;http://info.mbopartners.com/stateofindependence?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvKjNZKXonjHpfsX56uguWq6xlMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ATsBrI%2FqLAzICFpZo2FFVGO8%3D&gt; that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent. 

Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.
