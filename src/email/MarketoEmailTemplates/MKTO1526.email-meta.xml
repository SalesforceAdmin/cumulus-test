I looked into this with our team is here is what they want: While reviewing Williams recently submitted non-billable Communications expense for his Verizon mobile phone I noticed that the associate has entered this expense incorrectly. The first issue I noticed was that the associate has entered his mobile phone using two separate expenses, one expense is under Communications- Other which he has stated as the data/business line specific charges and it is equal to $36.37. The other expense is a Communications- phone Service expense for $79.00 when he is claiming 20% business so the reimbursement comes to $15.80. The Communications- Phone service expense is entered to account for his business line portion of the plan minutes which he calculated correctly at 20% since there are 5 lines on the bill. In order for this expense to be approved the associate will need to merge these two costs into a single expense by taking the $36.37 and adding the business plan cost of $15.80 to equal an expense total of $52.17. The associate will then need to adjust the business use percentage to accurately reflect his use off of the new total.  ·         I would request that the associate also submit the first page of the bill when he submits his expenses this will allow us to see the billing date range for the expense. The associate should use the ending date of the billing range to enter as the expense date. o   Both expenses are currently dated as: 06/20/12  this part can be updated when the first page is submitted. ·         If the associate wishes to expense 75% + as business (of the $52.17) he will also need to submit the itemized call logs for the business line.   Ok so after all of that here is what I did: ·         Merged the two expenses for a total of $52.17 (as suggested) $15.80 for 20% of phone bill and $36.37 for data.  Because you should be reimbursed the full $52.17 (as the % of business use has already been calculated) I put the business use at 100%. ·         This means you will need to upload the full bill (I would just pull the online PDF statement from your online Verizon account and upload that.) ·         When you upload the new bill please update the date of the expense to the end date of the billing range. I know this one is a little intense but the good news is once we have it done you can just hit copy previous so you wont have to re-invent the wheel when you next bill comes. To update the expense click on Expenses and click on the Verizon expense. You cannot update the expense from the review expense section (which I am guessing is why you were having trouble before.) Give me a call or an email with any and all questions!  Thanks Buddy!Sara  From: William Goodwin iv [mailto:wgoodwiniv@yahoo.com]

Subject: Billables   I am making the assumption that you are S.C. :) For the following expenses... 06/20/2012 Verizon $79.00 06/20/2012 Verizon $36.37  How would I put them in one bill if they have different percentages? Should I calculate the percentage cost before I enter the amount? Wouldnt that be confusing? There are 5 ppl on the cell phone talk time ($79). The data time is broken out individually and the $36.37 is just mine Also the date I entered is the due date. I should have put the bill date but when I tried to change it, I wasnt able to. Do I need to delete it and reenter the expense? Thanks, Buddy&lt;/d</textOnly>
