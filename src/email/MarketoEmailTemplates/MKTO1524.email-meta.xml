Subject: Invoicing from MBO Nicolette I received the attached 2 invoices today.  They cover the same period (5/1 – 5/31/12) as the previous monthly invoice for May.   We are in the process of payment for the prior May invoice(s) already so  I won’t be approving this for payment until the next monthly cycle. Regards,Jim  Jim BrinkerhoffCorporate Information SystemseBusiness Project Manager Analog Devices Inc.
