The next step is sending me a copy of your completed I-9.  You can find the I-9 form in your enrollment documents; you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.)  I will also need you to send me a copy of your US passport (you can just take a picture with your phone and email that to me.) I also need you to log in to MBO Access &lt;https://access.mbopartners.com/&gt; and complete the “Industry Expertise” and “Disciplines” sections of your profile. This information needed for our workmen’s comp. policy and must be completed before I can activate your account and get you billing. Your user ID and password is the same as your MBO Business Center.  Additionally, I have included an updated net cash estimate based off of your current project and settings in your MBO account. I know you went through this with Brendan but I thought a refresher would be helpful. This estimate assumes: ·         40 hours a week ·         $115 per hour·         10.02% 401(k) ·         Disability insurance –**please note you have to work an average of 25 hours a week in order to be eligible for this benefit, if you will not be working this much and would like to cancel the coverage please let me know** I would be more than happy to reivew the estimate with you via phone if you would like, please let me know. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
