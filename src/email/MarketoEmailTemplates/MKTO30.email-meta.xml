Enclosed are a few things we spoke about:
 
1.       Estimate showing you what your income would look like running through MBO
2.       Most common types of expenses you can submit for a deduction  
3.       Bill Rate calculator to help you determine your rate: http://www.mbopartners.com/#billrate
 
Again, our Service fee is 5% of the total amount that comes in from your clients whom you are using through MBO, that fee drops to 1.5% for every dollar after 125k and resets anniversary year of when you start.
 
Regards,
 
Steve
