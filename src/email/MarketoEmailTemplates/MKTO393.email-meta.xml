Hi Nicolette-I am going to hold off going forward with MBO Partners at this time since I have lean back office systems that require very little time since reorganizing this past summer .  However, it may make sense for me to revisit this decision in May 2012.  
 
Thanks for all your work informing me of the features and benefits of MBO.  I will try to send you referrals as I come across independent consultants and contractors.  Richard

Hi Richard,
 
I checked the schedule and Friday morning is available at 10:0am would that work for you?  I have sent you an invitation for this, please approve if it works and if not we can work on scheduling a different time.
 
Thank you and have a great day!
Nicolette

Hi Nicolette-Thanks for your follow-up.  Tuesday anytime or this coming Friday morning work best for me.  What openings to you have for the GoToMeeting session?  Richard

Hi Richard,
 
I hope all is well!  I wanted to follow up with you from our initial conversation to see if you had any additional questions for me.  I  know you had interest in seeing a demo of our site so  I would like to set up a time for us to speak so I could set up a go-to meeting with you to show you some of the system functionalities of the system.  
 
I also know you expressed interest in speaking with one of our current associates and there is actually a section on our website with testimonials and actual interview recordings of some of our Associates whom volunteered to speak with our marketing team about their experience with MBO.  The link to that portion of our site is below:
 
http://www.mbopartners.com/#successstories 
 
Please let me know when a good time to follow up with you will be by phone.  In order to schedule the Go To Meeting I will need at least a few days advance notice to make sure the time slot is available (we share 2 licenses with the whole office and a lot of people use this for their conference calls), so sometime next week would be best.
 
I look forward to speaking with you again soon!
 
Thank you,
 
Nicolette
