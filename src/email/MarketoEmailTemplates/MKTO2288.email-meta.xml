Subject: RE: question on becoming active again at MBO Hi Sarah and Sara

It&apos;s been a long time since last time we traded email. I am talking to a new client and had a couple questions for you.

1- What documents would I need to fill out in order to re-activate? New I-9 form, follow the re-enrollment steps above.
2- To have benefits through MBO do I have to bill a certain amount or work a certain number of hours per week or month? Yes, you need to bill around 80k a year. 
3- Does MBO have any direct relationships with Rogers Communications in Toronto or a company they use, www.ProCom.ca &lt;http://www.ProCom.ca&gt; ? Not that I can see but that certainly doesn’t mean we couldn’t get one in place. 

Please let me know

Subject: RE: question on becoming active again at MBO Hi Sarah
 
Wanted to get back to you with an update. Gardenia did go ahead and sign the form for me the day you wrote me this email, but I&apos;m holding onto it for now as the potential project I was contacted about has been postponed. I still intend to find another project soon but will wait until I have a good lead to go ahead and re-activate.
 
Thanks again for your help, it definitely makes the process much easier

I really apprecaite it. I know there is this other form which is the one they would notarize, i just haven&apos;t found a copy of it yet. If you have a copy could you please send me an email with that? It&apos;s a form they refer to in the I-9 and then they notarize that form

Subject: RE: question on becoming active again at MBODavid,Got your voicemail. The notary that we frequently use is in San Francisco, so I think that is a bit of a stretch.  I have looked up some notaries in your area:  http://www.notaryrotary.com/agent/searchdtlbody.asp?id=&amp;PostalCD=LATLON&amp;Address=95129&amp;City=&amp;l=&amp;ll=&amp;pfn=05133359001P&amp;bfn=05133359001B&amp;pmc=26&amp;bmc=11&amp;Miles=25&amp;LocType=&amp;StateCD=&amp;PostalState=&amp;PostalCounty=&amp;EstimateCost=0&amp;Lat=37.3052272&amp;Lon=-121.9871217&amp;Location=95129&amp;Override=1 &lt;http://www.notaryrotary.com/agent/searchdtlbody.asp?id=&amp;PostalCD=LATLON&amp;Address=95129&amp;City=&amp;l=&amp;ll=&amp;pfn=05133359001P&amp;bfn=05133359001B&amp;pmc=26&amp;bmc=11&amp;Miles=25&amp;LocType=&amp;StateCD=&amp;PostalState=&amp;PostalCounty=&amp;EstimateCost=0&amp;Lat=37.3052272&amp;Lon=-121.9871217&amp;Location=95129&amp;Override=1&gt;   Can you take a look and possibly give me a couple that are near you, and what I will do is call them and explain the situation myself to see if they will be able to accommodate before you go to them.  That way we can try and cut it down to one trip for you. Please let me know if you have any other questions in the meantime. Thanks,  Sarah Buckley MBO Partners Phone: 703-793-6037Fax: 703-793-6461 From: David Smith [mailto:david_t_smith@hotmail.com &lt;mailto:david_t_smith@hotmail.com&gt;]

also just curious why you sent me the expense policy - did it change recently? I would think whatever the client is willing to pay for we would invoice them for, correct?

Subject: RE: question on becoming active again at MBOHi David,It was great speaking with you today and thank you for your interest in MBO Partners again. I have re-attached some information just to refresh your memory on our expense policy.  Here is some information regarding obtaining a Hong Kong work visa:  http://hong-kong.travisa.com/VisaInstructions.aspx?CountryID=HK&amp; &lt;http://hong-kong.travisa.com/VisaInstructions.aspx?CountryID=HK&amp;&gt;  I have re-enabled your enrollment, so you can now log in with your username and password and re-enroll. If you need me to send you your username or reset your password let me know. I have attached the updated I-9 and instructions for you as well. If you use a passport as your I-9 document, please send a photo copy of the passport photo back with your I-9.  I am working on getting you a notary contact, so hold tight.  If you have any questions as you go through your enrollment, please let me know! Best regards, Sarah Buckley MBO Partners Phone: 703-793-6037Fax: 703-793-6461 From: David Smith [mailto:david_t_smith@hotmail.com &lt;mailto:david_t_smith@hotmail.com&gt;]

Subject: question on becoming active again at MBO Hi Amy
 
Last time we were in touch was October of 2009, at which time I had been looking for contracts but then the client forced me to go through one of their preferred contracting companies. At that time I had already filled out the I-9? paperwork for MBO Partners (the paperwork that required a notary which was difficult) but you&apos;d said you&apos;d keep it on file for the time being.
 
I have had a last-minute request to work on a contract basis for a local San Jose company but at their customer site overseas (Hong Kong). This would be for a few months starting asap. I wanted to see what would be involved in terms of:
 
1- being re-instated at MBO, hopefully without having to start over on the paperwork that had to be notarized
2- signing up for all the benefits
3- whether a Hong Kong work visa would need to be handled thorugh MBO (if I&apos;m technically your W-2) or if that can be performed by the local company or their customer
4- how long to make everything happen to get contracts done etc. and set up
 
This is far from a deal I&apos;m ready to sign on to, we&apos;ve only just started talking about this opportunity today. Personally I hate being given no advance notice but now that I have a potential opportunity I just need to understand what it would take and if we have any potential roadblocks.
 
Please give me a call at your earliest convenience, 408-569-2910.
 
-Dave
