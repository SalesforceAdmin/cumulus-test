Thanks for the reply; and I’m sure we will be here when the project is right for MBO.  
 
We do have some Mobile needs.  Can you please send me some examples of your work, perhaps a short paragraph about your capabilities so that I can send this to my CTO?
 
Thanks,
 
Steve

Hi Steven,
               I remember that I had a conversation with you earlier. But it will take some more time for me to make use of MBO. But before that, I would like to say that I am a iPhone/iPad/mobile app developer.  When I saw your website, I had in mind that your customers love to have your services on mobile. If you are interested in creating a mobile app for you company which offers the services in mobile/iphone/ipad, Please let me know. We can work it out.
 
Thanks,
Sharan.
