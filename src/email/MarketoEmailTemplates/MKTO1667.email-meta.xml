	- We have created an index of past webinars on topics specifically catered for independent consultants.  You can view our index by going here &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-webcast-index&gt;.  
 
	- In addition we have a 2012 Webinar track that will cover everything to do with working independently.  We have three tracks, you can sign up to receive notifications when new webinars are scheduled by going here &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/Webinar.html&gt;.
 
	- The estimates I created for you (attached PDF’s) show one with expenses in the amount of $2500/month.  The per diem lodging/meals in Buffalo is $156/day ($100 lodging, $56 meals/incidentals), so I multiplied that by 20 ( approx business days in a month) which came out to $3120, so to make the estimate a bit more conservative I just included $2500 of that as the expense amount in case you don’t work a full 20 days a month. 
 
	- Lastly, you can view all the information we spoke over the phone by going here &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/advisor-info-n-taylor.html&gt;.  
  Please schedule a convenient time for us to follow up using my online schedule &lt;https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK&gt;. I look forward to speaking with you again soon! Have a great evening,  Nicolette___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.com &lt;bbentley@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
