This establishes a maximum Business Center Match of $5,457.45, which is 5 times your Personal Deferral. Here is a snapshot of your retirement contributions as of Friday 7/13/12 Gross Pay$10,914.92 Personal Deferral$1,091.49 Business Center Match$3,274.47   Total Retirement$4,365.96  Note that 6% of your Gross pay is $654.895. Take this number times 5 and you arrive at current Business Center Match of $3,274.47.  Based on this, you have not yet reached the maximum Business Center Match contribution threshold of $5,457.45. As a result, each subsequent payroll Business Center Match Contributions will continue to be deducted as your Gross pay goes up until you hit $5,457.45.  Business Center Match Contributions will continue to be made until your gross pay reaches $18,190.00 when this occurs your contributions will look like this: Gross Pay$18,190.00 Personal Deferral$1,091.49 Business Center Match$5,457.45   Total Retirement$6,548.94  At this point your personal deferral will be 6% of your year-to-date Gross Pay, and your Business Center Contributions will be 5 times your Personal Deferral. No more Business Center Contributions will be made past $5,457.95 (provided you do not change your Personal Deferral.)  I hope this explanation helps. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you need more clarification. Best,Sara___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
