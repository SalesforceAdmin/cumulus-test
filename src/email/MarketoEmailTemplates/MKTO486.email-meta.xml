Thank you for your interest in MBO Partners.  I wanted to introduce myself as the person at MBO Partners responsible for all new associate and partnership requests and I received your information from Steve Arhancet to follow up with you. I’ll be your main point of contact to provide you an overview of our services or answer any specific questions you may have.  
 
I know you mentioned your computer blocked the pop up of Steve’s calendar so I wanted to let you know I am available to speak tomorrow at either 10:00 or 11:00 EST or Friday I am available in the morning between 10:00-11:30 or after 3:00.  You may also try again to book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here: https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK
 
You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube: http://youtu.be/zKDzwSTmGv4. 
 
I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners!
 
Thank you and have a great evening,
 
Nicolette
