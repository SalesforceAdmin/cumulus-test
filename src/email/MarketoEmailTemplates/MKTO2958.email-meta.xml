Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Michael RampollaHi Nicolette -Actually, your timing is pretty good!  I have a meeting tomorrow (Monday Oct 14) with a very strong contender for my first &quot;real independent consultant&quot; contract!  (They don&apos;t know that, but that&apos;s just good consulting, right?  &quot;Look like you&apos;ve been there before.&quot;) – That’s great you’ve got the right approach! In any case:  If necessary, how quickly can I get set up with MBO?  - Within a day (assuming you can get to a notary), I will send you the online enrollment so you have it.  From what I know of this client -- Johnson Controls -- they prefer to work through &quot;vendor brokers&quot; -- hopefully, MBO is one of them?  Do you know? Unfortunately, we are not at this time but I am sure we would have no trouble meeting their credentials if they were willing to do business with us. If things move forward Nicolette can help you with the approach (she will be back on Wednesday) I am also happy to help as well if things move along sooner. What I&apos;m most interested in / concerned about is the Contract itself.  I&apos;ve been in discussions with them and have been working with a proposal that quotes both an hourly rate and two &quot;milestone&quot; rates (two-phase project).  But I definitely do not have any legal language or formal SOW content in the proposal -- in-scope, out-of-scope, provisions / guarantees, etc. We can help you with this; we have sample statements of work on our Independent’s Guide &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide?mkt_tok=2xUAKZjCekNesEli4vKYArn5kjDEc5msvq90Dvn1nMwx1CIUGIalUg%3D%3D&gt; which you can access by clicking here &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/SOW_Template.pdf&gt;. Thanks in advance for your help!  If all goes well, hopefully I can stall them on paperwork and get in touch with you late morning.  (Nothing like giving you plenty of lead-time, right?!) Fingers crossed! I will send you an email to send to them to introduce MBO. Please be sure not to sign anything with them until MBO reviews the paperwork. Thanks in advance for your flexibility and assistance!

Regards,
-Michael______________________
