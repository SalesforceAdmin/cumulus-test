Thank you so much for contacting me, Steven. Your email is very timely, as I am considering this for the near future. Currently, I am an IT contractor/consultant working with a large government contracting company. Actually, I have worked for several, having been in the IT field for over 20 years.
 
I see you guys have improved your website a lot. Great info!
 
I will definitely be setting up a phone call very soon. I just want to go through all your new info and jot down all my questions first. Should I contact you directly, or use the appointment scheduling tool? I also know several others like myself who would be interested in doing the same thing.
 
Thanks a lot.
 
Steven Page

Dear Steven,
I wanted to share the news that MBO Partners just released a study that you may be interested in. For the first time, theres real hard facts about The State of Independence in America that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent.
Thats not all. We recently re-launched our Web site which includes relevant tools such as a Bill Rate Calculator, a self-assessment tool on independence, and a video that shows how we help independents succeed in todays project economy. We encourage you to take a look.
Take a moment to instantly schedule an appointment if youd like to take advantage of my time and interest in the independent professionals unique challenges and needs.
Are you currently working in a W2 role and thinking of starting your first contract? Are you already working independently and have a new project commencing? Now is a great time to connect with MBO Partners.
As always, were here to make it easier for independent consultants to do business.
Steven Arhancet
