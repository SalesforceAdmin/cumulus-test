    <subject>MBO Partners Independent Consulting Brief - September 2013</subject>
    <textOnly>SPOTLIGHT
This month, I was privileged to sit on a panel with some of the best and brightest thinkers around the #futureofwork at SXSW V2V, a conference that brought together those who want to galvanize America’s start-up economy. America’s independent consultants and contractors have entered the start-up space as solopreneurs.


Read my post-mortem blog &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/future-now&gt; on the event, and don’t forget to sign up to receive the 2013 State of Independence &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/independent-workforce-index.html&gt; report next month to catch exciting new data about the independent workforce.

IS INDEPENDENT CONSULTING RIGHT FOR YOU?
If you’re considering going solo as an independent consultant, you aren’t alone. Independence resonates across the generations and those who have made the transition have built satisfying careers. MBO Partner’s 5 annual predictions for work  &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/5-predictions.html&gt; suggest it’s a good time to develop a strategy and approach to help you get on the bandwagon. We think that by the end of the decade, more than half of the private U.S. workforce will be career independents.

However, the rewards of a consultant business are accompanied by some burdens that require careful consideration. The independent assumes the challenges, risks, and infrastructure of running a business. There is no outside organization providing a steady paycheck, benefits, retirement programs and job security. The independent must find work and ensure that they develop and sustain a steady pipeline of opportunity. They must qualify to work with a large company, which often means additional insurance and compliance burdens.

This month, we feature Consultant Services Advisor Nicolette Taylor, who shares her conversations with a busy consulting practice owner that found an easier, cost effective way to operate his small project-based contracts.

MBO Q &amp; A
Q. How does MBO Partners compare to self-incorporation?

A. Instead of choosing the route of self-incorporation, you can work within one of MBO’s services and receive the same limited liability protections you would have if you set up an LLC or S Corp. You will pay yourself on a W-2, versus multiple 1099s, making you more attractive to lenders when applying for any type of loan or mortgage.

We can also qualify you as a vendor to work with large companies. If MBO already has an agreement in place with a client you&apos;re interested in consulting with, you can avoid the time and effort required to establish a direct vendor status. Also, If you need to bring on additional consultants to complete your projects, MBO will provide a Team Center for you to easily and efficiently disseminate payments to other people in accordance with the terms and conditions of their statements of work.

FEATURED PROFILE
Meet Kathryn Schultea &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/meet-the-independents-in&gt;, gained a wealth of bankruptcy consulting knowledge after the company she worked for went under. She became an expert on the steps required to wind down a company from beginning to end, and decided to become an independent to work on other reorganization opportunities. While some may find independent life isolating, for Kathy the flexibility has been easy to adapt to, as she is able to spend time with her two teenagers and keep up with their activities and events.
