Subject: Engagements In The Queue Sara, This is a note to explain the message I left on your phone today. Things are looking up – a little.  A fellow who runs a PMP training company wants me to deliver his courseware a couple times in June, and I am closing on an engagement that could be long term for 24-40 hours a week.   The name of the first outfit is Best Practices PMP Training, owned and operated by Mark Tolbert.  The second opportunity is with ManTech SRS Technologies -  believe they have an MSA in place. I would like to schedule a call to help me get started with the paperwork.  When is a good time? Tom</textOnly>
