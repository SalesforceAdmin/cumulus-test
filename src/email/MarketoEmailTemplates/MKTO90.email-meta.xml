I wanted to follow up with you as a courtesy from our conversation about a month ago.  I received your contact information from Amber Johnson here at MBO Partners.  Our firm works closely with firms like yours that uses independent consultants/1099’s.  You can learn more on our website www.mboenterprise.com.  I would love to speak with you more about what we do and how we work. 
 
Regards,
 
Steve
