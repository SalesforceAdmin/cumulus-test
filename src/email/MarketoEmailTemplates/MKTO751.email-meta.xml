Sara, 
I am currently under contract. At this time I am not in need of MBO Partners Services but I may need your services at a later date. If need be I will get in touch with you at that time. Thanks for all the info.

Dear Bill , 
 
Some time ago you requested information regarding the services offered by MBO Partners.  Now might not be the right time for you.  Whatever your work life stage, I also hope you can join me in celebrating the news that independent work life in America has arrived. Our company is well into a year-long effort called The State of Independence in America. 
 
I encourage you to view some very interesting findings on the size and trends for independent work in our nation.
 
Are you working on a contract/project now or are you currently working W2 at the moment?
 
Best regards,
Sara
