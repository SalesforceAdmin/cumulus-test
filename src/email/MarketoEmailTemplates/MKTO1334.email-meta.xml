	- We have created an index of past webinars on topics specifically catered for independent consultants.  You can view our index by going here &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-webcast-index&gt;.  
 
	- In addition we have a 2012 Webinar track that will cover everything to do with working independently.  We have three tracks, you can sign up to receive notifications when new webinars are scheduled by going here &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/Webinar.html&gt;.
 
	- Lastly, you can view all the information we spoke over the phone by going here &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/advisor-info-n-taylor.html&gt;.  
 If you have questions, feel free to schedule a convenient time for you using my online schedule. I look forward to speaking with you soon!  Nicolette___________________________________Nicolette TaylorConsultant Services AdvisorMBO Partners t: 703.793.6281f: 703.793.6456e: ntaylor@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
