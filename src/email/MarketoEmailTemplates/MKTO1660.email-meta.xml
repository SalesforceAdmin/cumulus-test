We are sorry to see you go, but I personally wanted to share a few important pieces of information with you to help with the transition to alumni status. Should you have another potential project, we can easily re-activate your account. Important Business Center Actions  There are just a few important items to review: Once all contributions have been posted, you may have your 401(k) funds transferred to a new retirement plan, or you may elect to continue your portfolio with Fidelity. Employee-side contributions will post to your Fidelity account within two weeks of the last payroll. The employer-side matching and profit sharing will post in the last week of the following month. To manage your retirement options, please contact Fidelity directly at www.401kxpress.com &lt;http://www.401kxpress.com&gt; or via phone at (800) 294-401K. Ways to Stay Connected:  I have enjoyed working with you. All of us at MBO Partners hope you stay connected to our community. There are many ways to stay in touch: As an alumni, you still have the ability to freely visit the growing MBO Access Community &lt;https://access.mbopartners.com/welcome&gt;. Here, you can make meaningful connections with other Associates and Clients, while having access to excellent resources and perks.  Join our Webinar Series &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/2012SeriesSignUp.html?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonsqvLZKXonjHpfsX56%2BUtW6G1lMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ASMBmI%2FqLAzICFpZo2FFVGO8%3D&gt; for premier independent consulting related content, and follow us on Facebook &lt;http://hr-hr.facebook.com/mbopartners&gt;, Twitter &lt;http://twitter.com/#!/MBOpartners&gt;, and LinkedIn. When you come back to MBO Partners for your next project, just let us know that you liked or followed us on our social networks and we’ll send you a $25.00 Amazon Gift Card. Also be sure to catch up with other MBO Associates in our Meet the Independents Series &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/meet-the-independents.html&gt;, which profiles Independents from all 50 states!  Pass It On, and Get Rewarded:  We appreciate your business, and wanted you to know that as an MBO alumni, you still qualify to earn a bonus for every successful Associate you refer to us. Please click here &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/referral-program&gt; to learn more about why many of our Associates refer us to peers, colleagues and friends. I hope we’ll see you again – and don’t forget that your next project opportunity can be run through MBO.  Once you secure the work, you can simply reply to this email and I’ll take it from there, so please keep it handy!  Please let me know if you have any further questions. We wish you well and I hope to hear from you soon.  Best wishes,Sara (on behalf of Nicolette Tyalor)___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
