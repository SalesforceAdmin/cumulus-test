Subject: Re: net cash Hi Sara,

Hope you doing well,

could you please let me know how this &quot;Net Cash&quot; spreadsheet may change if we add one dependent: my daughter, living with me.
and one more question: how often can I submit my expenses (weekly/monthly? ). 

Thank you for your help and consideration

Sincerely
