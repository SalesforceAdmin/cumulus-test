Subject: Re: MBO Call Follow Up Gotcha. It looks like it was originally at 80% (50% + 30% match). Let&apos;s put it at 65% (50% + 15% match). Thanks! Macon On Fri, Apr 13, 2012 at 3:51 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com&gt; wrote:Hi Macon, I am sorry I misunderstood. The 401(k) estimation tool doesn’t work that way, you need to let me know the total percentage you would like to be contributed and then I will do the math to find out what the employee deferral will need to be so the match and the deferral equal add up to that total percentage. I cannot use the tool based on the dollar amount contribution. Sorry for the inconvenience,  Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: Re: MBO Call Follow Up Thanks... Sorry, I&apos;d like to keep the full 401K self contribution at 17K, but just change the match part to 15% from the business center portion (the match was originally at 30%). MaconOn Fri, Apr 13, 2012 at 3:38 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;&gt; wrote:Sure thing – please see updates attached.

Subject: Re: MBO Call Follow Up Hi Sara, Thanks for this! Is there any way to lower the non-billables to $200 (I can walk to work) and lower the retirement match to 15% (currently at 30%)? Thanks! Macon On Fri, Apr 13, 2012 at 3:11 PM, Sara Conde &lt;sconde@mbopartners.com&gt; wrote:Dear Macon , It was a pleasure speaking with you.  You’ll find everything that I referenced on our call by going here.
