On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with you and your organization.  If you have 10 minutes I would love to share some background on our organization and also understand your business to ensure we process everything according to the way you would like.
 
You may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here: https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK as my calendar is currently filled for the remainder of the day.
 
Here is quick summary of who we are you may review before we speak: http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Introduction.pdf
 
I look forward to speaking with you.  
 
Thank you,
Nicolette
