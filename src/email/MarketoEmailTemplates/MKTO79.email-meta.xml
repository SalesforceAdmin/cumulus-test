Hi Wayne
 
Thank you for your call today!  As discussed, I have enabled a re-enrollment for you, so if you login to www.mbopartners.com, you will be able to click on “enrollment forms,” and complete the process – also, given that it has been a few years since you have been with us, you will need a new I-9 form.
 
I am copying Steve Arhancet on this email, as he manages the enrollment team, so please feel free to reach out to him with your client’s contact details – he’ll be more than happy to get the ball rolling for you
 
Thanks and all the best
