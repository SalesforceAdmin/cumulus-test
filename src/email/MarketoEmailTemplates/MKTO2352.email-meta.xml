Subject: Possible arrangement Hi, 

I was an independent consultant working through MyBizOffice from 1999 - 2002.  (Was that you?)  My circumstances have changed a lot since then, but I would like to explore a possible arrangement with you. 

I own a new, small business and the only workers I have so far are my wife and me.  My COBRA medical insurance ends in four months.  Personal medical insurance is not as good as group medical insurance.  Could you hire my wife and contract with my company for her compensation in order to let her have your group medical insurance for our family? 

Thanks, 

Steven Alexander
