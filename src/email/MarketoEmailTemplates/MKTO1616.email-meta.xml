Enjoy your sabbatical  distressing is a MUST! So many people never allow themselves that.  You can call me at any time but there is no need for an interview as we do not do any placements or staffing. We are simply here to assist you with the back office admin of a 1099 enagment.  Take care and good luck!Sara   From: Eiko Smith [mailto:eikosmithnow@yahoo.com]

Subject: Re: MBO Partners / Eiko Smith Hi Sarah - good to hear from you - I appreciate your touching base. At the moment, I am taking some long-needed time off from everything, and just coastin&apos; for the next few weeks. Part of it to simply de-compress and de-stress, and part of it is to see if proposal management is a direction I want to pursue.  There&apos;s a lot that I enjoy about it, but there are aspects that I&apos;m not so sure of.  In a few weeks, would it be possible for me to send you my resume, proposal writing samples, and schedule a phone interview with you?   I have been doing proposal management for a year, have joined the APMP, took their day-long Boot Camp last April, and checking into the possibility of taking their Foundation accreditation in September. I&apos;m hoping that perhaps you could answer some of my questions about the field in general. Hope all is well, and that you&apos;ve been keeping cool during our recent heat wave. Kind regards,Eiko

Hello Eiko,
I wanted to follow up with you from our conversation regarding the services provided by MBO Partners.  You mentioned you may be starting a new consulting contract. How is that going?
Here are a few tools that summarize our conversation from before:
	- There are some webinars and videos we have created that might assist you in finding your next contract if you have not already found one:

           http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-webcast-index &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPXByb2QtbC0yNDYmbWVzc2FnZWlkPTI0NiZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEzMzQ4ODgzMzgmc2VyaWFsPTEyNjQ4NjQyMDImZW1haWxpZD1laWtvc21pdGhub3dAeWFob28uY29tJnVzZXJpZD1sLTEyOC0xMTc5Ny05NDg0NyZleHRyYT0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.mbopartners.com/mbo-partners-webcast-index?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvKjNZKXonjHpfsXx7%2BQpXrHr08Yy0EZ5VunJEUWy2YEDRdQhcOuuEwcWGog8zQ5X&gt;
	- MBO Partners continues to invest in being a leader for independent consultants across the country. I also wanted to share the news that we released a study you may be interested in. For the first time, theres real hard facts about The State of Independence in America &lt;http://mkto-l0128.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPXByb2QtbC0yNDYmbWVzc2FnZWlkPTI0NiZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEzMzQ4ODgzMzgmc2VyaWFsPTEyNjQ4NjQyMDImZW1haWxpZD1laWtvc21pdGhub3dAeWFob28uY29tJnVzZXJpZD1sLTEyOC0xMTc5Ny05NDg0NyZleHRyYT0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;http://info.mbopartners.com/stateofindependence?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvKjNZKXonjHpfsXx7%2BQpXrHr08Yy0EZ5VunJEUWy2YEDRdQhcOuuEwcWGog8zQ5X&gt; that will reveal not just how many millions of independent professionals there are in the country, but also the unique things that motivate them and help them stay happily independent. 

Any update would be great, look forward to hearing from you.
