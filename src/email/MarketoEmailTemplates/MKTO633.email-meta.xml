Sorry we missed each other today.  I’ll be around over the weekend.  I have skype, but I use it for personal stuff – If you don’t mind that you can add me ‘sarhancet’.

Jake,
 
I hate to reschedule on you; but I have a meeting that came up that I need to attend during our 4pm scheduled call.  Can we move our call to Friday morning or afternoon?
