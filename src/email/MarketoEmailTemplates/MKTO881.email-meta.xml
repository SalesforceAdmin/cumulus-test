Hi Steve,
 
Thanks for your email, and I hope you and yours are enjoying the new year so far.
 
I have yet to work on any contracts through OST Global Solutions; however, I&apos;m currently working on a long-term contract through a firm called TalentBurst, who don&apos;t offer any contractor benefits package of their own. Would I be able to sign up for any of MBO Partners&apos; benefits while working for TalentBurst, or are they exclusive to OST? Please advise at your earliest convenience, and I look forward to your reply.
 
Kind regards,
Daniel Buchanan
