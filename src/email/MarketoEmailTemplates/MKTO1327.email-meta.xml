It was so nice speaking with you today. It turns out there is a reason why I didn’t know anything about the Insight account – because I am not the Account Manager! We actually have a dedicated Account Manager who works with Insight; Christina Rojas (copied above.) She will be your point of contact moving forward and I have caught her up to speed on our conversation. In the meantime here is some background on what we discussed: Independent Contractor compliance requires that you maintain independence in three primary areas: Behavioral Control, Financial Control, and Type of Relationship (see the IRS rules http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762.html). http://mboenterprise.com/how-we-help/mitigate-risk Thanks and good luck!Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
