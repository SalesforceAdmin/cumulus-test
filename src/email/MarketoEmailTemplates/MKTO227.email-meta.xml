I spoke with Juli on Monday about the process and she said at that time she was waiting to get our contract back from their department that was reviewing it and I should get it shortly but I have not yet received it back.  She did say though that they only had one real concern that I think we will be able to address so unless there are multiple issues with the contract it should be easy to complete.  If I do not get anything from Juli by the end of the day I will reach out to her again to get a status update.  Is there anything else you have any questions about?
 
Thanks!
Nicolette

Nicollete, 
 
Thanks for the note.   The contract is being reviewed by our deputy general counsel and I hope to have his comments or approval of the agreement by the end of the week. 
 
I will sign up for an morning slot on Monday, 26 September to talk you about the process for adding task orders to the agreement once it is in place. 
 
Best,
Juli

Dear Nicolette, 
 
 Apologies for my delayed response.   Thank you for the contract.   We will review it and get back to you by early next week.
 
I would like to set up a time to talk you after we signed the contract about setting up the task orders.  I envision that we will have an umbrella strategic advisory task order with John Fittipaldi that would give us access to his services on an as needed basis. 
 
I will look forward to working with you and John.  
 
Best, 
Juli

Nicolette,
 
OK, I had a substantial conversation with Marstel Day this morning. It appears that they will want to establish a working consultative relationship with me. 
 
Juli MacDonald Winbush will be the point of contact for Marstel Day with MBO Partners.
 
I&apos;ve completed the enrollment process and signed the agreement. The proverbial ball is now in your court. Please advise if I can answer any questions that might arise.
 
Regards,
 
John
