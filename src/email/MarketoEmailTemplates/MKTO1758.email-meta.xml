Do we have any legal consul we could recommend for someone who is looking for help drafting international licensing and secrecy agreements,? Clearly, this is not a fit for MBO but as an act of good will I told this prospect I would look into it. Thanks,Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
