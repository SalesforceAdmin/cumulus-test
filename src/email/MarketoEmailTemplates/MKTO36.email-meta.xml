I wanted to as a courtesy follow up with you from our conversation a few weeks ago.  I wanted to make sure you received all the information that I sent over to you.  Please let me know if you have any questions or when you are ready to get your online account set-up.  I can send over the link for you to get this started and then we can work on getting your first contract set-up in that account. 
 
Look forward to hearing back from you soon,
 
Steve
