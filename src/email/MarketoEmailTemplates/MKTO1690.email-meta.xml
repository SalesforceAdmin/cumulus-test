You should have received the COI listing Calivn Groups as holder and our W-9. All we need know is for you to sign and complete our standard agreement &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_MSA_Template.pdf&gt; and statement of work &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_SOW.pdf&gt;  so we can get an invoice out to you for the work Max has already completed. Please let me know if you have any questions. The sooner we can execute the better as I know Max has three weeks in arrears that needs to be billed and paid out. Thank you!Sara___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Importance: High Dear Dakota ,  My name is Sara and I am a Consultant Services Advisor at MBO Partners. Your name was forwarded to me by Max Katz. On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with your firm. MBO Partners caters to two markets.  Our first service is designed for independent consultants and  small businsses &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/#howwehelp&gt; who choose to plug into our MBO Services Cloud to make it easier for them to work with their clients.  We take care of all the back office administrative, HR, regulatory and financial issues so they can stay focused on delivering on their services.  The second is how we help enterprise organizations engage more efficently and safely with their contract workforce &lt;http://www.mboenterprise.com/how-we-help&gt;.  We have also put together a short one page collateral &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Introduction.pdf&gt; that explains how we work and the markets we serve. The following links provide our standard agreement &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_MSA_Template.pdf&gt; and statement of work &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_SOW.pdf&gt;  we use when engaging our Associates with their clients.  Please review and complete it, and return a signed copy to me.
