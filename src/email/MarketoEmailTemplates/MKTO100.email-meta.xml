I received your email with the information regarding the veterans credits.  For now, it does not look like we would be able to pass through any of these benefits through to you in the manner you are looking to .  I think for now, you may have to set-up your own company and employ these workers to claim the tax credits.  Please keep us in mind should you ever need us to invoice your company to pay a non-vet consultant.  We can help with payroll, taxes and administration. 
 
Regards,
 
Steve
