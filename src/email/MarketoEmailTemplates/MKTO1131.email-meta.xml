With your permission I would send the attached contract along with the email below to the client. One thing I noticed in the contract that I wanted to point out is that SNC doesn’t have to make payment on our invoices until they receive payment from their client.  I have asked them how long they anticipate that to be below.  Thanks!Sara ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ Dear X, On behalf of everyone here at MBO Partners, we look forward to working with you and your organization.  I have reviewed the agreement and enclosed the revised version with our information.  I have included a copy that lists our changes as well as a clean copy should you accept them for your counter signature.  Here are the list of changes and explination for each one: 
	-  2nd  Paragraph - Due to our role as an employer or record for tax purposes and not that of a staffing agency we have not vetted the skills of the subcontraor thus, we need to put “to the best of our knowelege” in this section. 	- Section 3 – Since you will remit paymen to us once your client remits payment to you we would like to ask what the net payment terms are that you have in place with your client?	- Section 5 Indemnity - We prefer to use our standard indemnity language. 
 If you are curious about MBO Partners and what we do and how we work, we have a short one page overview that may answer some of your questions, which you may access by going here.I look forward to working with you,   Best regards, Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
