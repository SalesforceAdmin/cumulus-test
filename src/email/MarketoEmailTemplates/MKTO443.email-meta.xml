I hope you are also well, thank you for reaching out.  MBO is actually not a payroll company, but a consulting services firm that allows independent consultants to work under our corporate structure and manage their back office support through our systems.  We do not sponsor H-1B visas because we lack control over the workers that is required when sponsoring a candidate because our consultants find their own work and we do not manage their hours, pay etc.  I don’t usually work with any payroll companies so I don’t know anyone off the top of my head but if I come across someone I would be happy to pass the information along to you.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
 
Thank you,
Nicolette

Hello Nicolette,
 
I hope you are doing well. 
 
I wasn’t sure if this was something that MBO Partners handle. I know you are a payroll company but does your firm also sponsor H-1B candidates. If not, are there any firms you work with that you might recommend. 
 
Thank you for your assistance. 
 
Regards,
