Dear Lua,
 
Thank you for the inquiry you submitted at the MBO Partners website.  I wanted to introduce myself as the person at MBO Partners responsible for all new associate and partnership requests.
 
 I saw the notes in  the inquiry you placed and it seems you had questions about recriting services and wanted to let you know that MBO does not provide any recruiting services, we mainly help consultants manage their back office once they have found a contract position and allowing them to operate like a consultant (for example, pay taxes like a consultant, deduct operating expenses, etc) but for filing purposes we would issue them a W2 .   If you are on a H1B visa we are unable to hold that visa for you so I am not sure if our services are what you are looking for, but if you are still interested in hearing more about our service, I will be your main point of contact to provide you an overview or answer any specific questions you may have.  You may easily book a time that is convenient for you on my online schedule by going here: https://my.timedriver.com/9TGRK
 
You can also watch a short video about who we are on You Tube: http://youtu.be/zKDzwSTmGv4. 
 
I look forward to speaking with you and sharing more information about MBO Partners!
