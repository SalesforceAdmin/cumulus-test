MOBILE CONSULTING: HOW TO MAXIMIZE YOUR MOBILE DEVICE FOR YOUR BUSINESS
Since the rise of PalmPilots and other personal data assistants in the early 1990s, mobile devices have been changing the way professionals do business. As mobile technology becomes more integrated into modern work practices, clients may simply expect you to have mobile capabilities.

Check leading tech blogs like Gadgetwise to see which devices are right for you. Remember: maintaining consistency across their electronics can simplify synching and file sharing. However, each mobile platform is compatible with any other computer or operating system, so don’t feel tied to a platform if it means sacrificing features that are important to you.

This month, we feature advisor Sara Conde, who shares how she was able to break down independent consulting into something simple— and how it inspired a new independent to get her first contract.   

“This consultant didn’t want her hand held; she wanted to keep her own brand and find her own work. All I did was provide her with a solid base to start on and the confidence that she could do it.”

TESTIMONIAL
“MBO really lets me combine convenience and benefits of W-2 employment with the luxury of being an independent. With MBO I have the freedom to work for whatever client I want, wherever I want.... With everything they offer, I’m convinced that the nominal fee MBO charges is one of the best investments I can make in my independent career.”
