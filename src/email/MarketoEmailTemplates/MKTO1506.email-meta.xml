Subject: Next StepsHi Norman , 
 
You need to complete the online enrollment which was just sent to you in a sepereate email (also attached.) Please log in and complete the online enrollment as soon as possible. 
 
At the end, an I-9 will populate; you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don&apos;t need a hard copy.)  I will also need you to send me a copy of your US passport (you can just take a picture with your phone and email that to me.)
 
Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
 
Thanks!
Sara

Hi Norman,
 
Sure did, she is very nice and said she will send our agreement to legal and we will start the process.  I asked her to copy you on all communications so we could keep you in the loop.
 
Thanks!
Sara

Hi Norman,
 
At the end of the year you are considered a W-2 employee of MBO Partners for tax purposes. MBO will issue you a W-2 and you file We like regular employee. We do not prepare taxes but the cost to prepare you taxes (if you even need help) should be reduced since you no longer will have a complicated 1099 and schedule C.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
 
Thank you,
Sara

Hello Sara ,
We spoke the other day regarding my enrollment. 
My question is in the eyes of the govt would I be  considered a W-2 of MBO or 1099 independent?
Are my end of year taxes included in the pkg?
 
Thanks Norman
