<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">I&rsquo;m sorry you could not attend the recent HCI webcast, &ldquo;Is Your Workforce a Class Action Waiting to Happen?&rdquo;&nbsp;We understand how busy everyone is and how the day can get away from you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">It was an informative session that delved into the legal complexities and consequences of using independent contractors and consultants. Two leading labor and employment law attorneys, Eric Rumbaugh and Suellen Oswald, agreed that HR needs to be more engaged on this subject. Consultants are a vital and growing part of the total workforce and it isn&rsquo;t good enough to let Procurement (or other areas of your business) handle these resources without the benefit of HR&rsquo;s guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">As a courtesy to you, please find linked a recent article titled &ldquo;<a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/ACC%20Top%20Ten%20Full%20Article%20Final.pdf"><strong>Top 10 Ways to Determine if You Have an Independent Contractor Compliance Issue</strong></a>.&rdquo; I believe that this article, which was recently posted to the Association of Corporate Counsel web site (<a href="http://www.acc.com">www.acc.com</a>), will prove helpful in determining if your business carries potential IC-related risks. It could also help keep your Finance, Procurement, and Legal stakeholders abreast of this critical issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">I hope you find the article valuable, and please know that I am always available if you would like<span style="color: #1f497d;"> </span>further assistance.</span></p></span>
<p>Warmest regards,</p>
