I do know one of our large clients, Proposal Development Consultants &lt;http://www.proposaldc.com/&gt;, places folks. They may be worth getting in contact with as they pay the MBO fee and have net 15 payment terms. I am not sure if you scope of work would line up with their needs or not. Check out their site and if you think there could be any kind of a fit I will gladly introduce you.  Best of luck,Sara ___________________________________ SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; We’ve got some serious perks you’re eligible to win when you refer a friend &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program?r=conde&gt; to MBO Partners!

Subject: Question Hi Sara, Does MBO have clients who work with you to get peopleplaced with them? Reason I ask is that both Sue and I have been put on half timewith Apex for the time being because of lack of projects to work on. So we are both looking for other (possibly less than fulltime) workto fill in the gaps. Mary Mary Laude
