We were able to walk through the program and we have another call scheduled at 10:30am tomorrow morning to go over a cash flow estimate. Barring anything unforeseen, it looks like Carla will be moving forward with the program so we will need to execute the agreement between BTG and MBO.  The following links provide our standard agreement &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_MSA_Template.pdf&gt; and statement of work &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_SOW.pdf&gt;  we use when engaging our Associates with their clients. If you would prefer to work with your own agreement, that is totally fine, please send that over for us to reivew. Looking forward to working with you and Carla! Have a wonderful evening, Sara___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.com &lt;mailto:sconde@mbopartners.com&gt;w: www.mbopartners.com &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/&gt; Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
