So nice speaking with you. To summarize our call:
 
·         Please complete the online enrollment. At the end, an I-9 will populate; you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.) 
 
·         As MBO is not signing the contract with the client you will need to sign  Contract Acknowledgement Form and send back to me via email. 
 
·         I have attached a blank SOW for the client to fill out so we have all the information needed to set up the project in the MBO system.
 
Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any and all questions.
 
Thanks Ann,
Sara
