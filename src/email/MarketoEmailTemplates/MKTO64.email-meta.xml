Thank you for showing interest in MBO Partners.  I noticed you booked an appointment in my schedule for this afternoon, however because you are seeking to learn more about a Systems Analyst position in OK, I will first need an electronic version of your CV.  If you can please reply all with that file, we will route it to the proper channels and then touch base with you should our CIO find interest. 
 
Regards,
 
Steve
