Getting Ready for a Stress-Free Tax Season
Whether you go it alone or hire a tax preparation professional, tax season doesn&apos;t have to be daunting. As long as you prepare yourself ahead of time with the proper steps and information, you can be ready to make your annual tax filing simple and painless.

When the deadline for filing annual taxes approaches, the last thing you want to be doing is scrambling to get all of your financial data together.  Ideally, the majority of the information you’ll need – records of expenses and documentation of all income – is already consolidated through your MBO Business Center, whether you use an outside accountant or rely on your own billing and accounting software. You should also make sure that you have access to the documents that show your income and expenses, either in paper or digital form. Should you get audited, having thorough documentation can be invaluable. Read more &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/getting-ready-stress-free-tax-season&gt;.

One of the most effective ways to market yourself online is to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry, as an influencer whose words are quoted and whose content is shared by a large number of people.

CEO CORNER
Tax Time: The Misclassification Window is Shrinking
The taxman cometh, and as you sift through the deluge of advice on the internet (both good and bad) on independent consultant taxes this year, I&apos;d like to leave you some food for thought that normally flies under the consultant&apos;s radar.
For your enterprise clients and other businesses that use independents, as Bob Dylan once crooned: the times, they are a-changin&apos; - and fast. More&gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/CEOCornerMarch2014.html&gt;
EXEC BOOK REVIEW
Amy O&apos;Donnell, Chief Talent Officer, on Management for ICs
In the future, could management positions be held by independents? Is it happening already?
