And the Winner of the MBO Home Office Makeover is....(drum roll, please)
MBO’s First Annual Home Office Makeover sweepstakes was a wonderful success! We had hundreds of referrals, and our greatest compliment is when our Associates refer us &lt;http://referral.mbopartners.com/referral-program&gt; to friends and colleagues who they believe would benefit from our services. We here at MBO feel your deeds should be recognized, which is why we developed a sweet deal to reward our Associates who are proud to share the MBO experience. For each referral you submitted to MBO, you earned an offical entry into our Home Office Makeover Sweepstakes in addition to the referral bonus program. Check out how we picked our winner as we tell the story in pictures &lt;http://www.mbopartners.com/blog/and-home-office-makeover-winner&gt;.

CEO CORNER
It&apos;s More Than a Project: Take Pride in Independence 

16.9 million workers in America have experienced working independently, and within 5 years, that number will rise to 23 million. About 70 percent of those workers report high levels of satisfaction in their lifestyle, compared to 19 percent of traditional workers &lt;http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2012/05/18/new-survey-majority-of-employees-dissatisfied/&gt;. The sea change is clear; working by the project is the future of American labor.

So, what does 23 million mean for you?  More&gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/CEOCornerJuly2013.html&gt;
BOOK REVIEW
Kimball Norup, VP Western Region

Like many professionals I have a bookshelf in my office filled with interesting or recommended business books that I bought with every good intention of reading.



Unfortunately this collection has grown larger over the years as my available time to read clearly hasn’t matched my book buying appetite! There is, however, one book on that shelf that I have already read. More &gt; &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/BookReviewKimballNorupJuly2013.html&gt;
