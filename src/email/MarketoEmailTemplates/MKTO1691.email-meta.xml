Subject: Re: Appointment Confirmation I enjoyed speaking with you today.  Thank you for answering all my questions.  I&apos;m looking forward to the possibility of working with MBO.

As I said, I&apos;m still in the idea stage.  I&apos;ve just started gathering a list of potential companies I might be interested in working with.  In case you happen to have any consultants currently working at any of these companies, I&apos;ve included a short list.  Most of these are small companies; I&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised if you&apos;ve worked with them.  (I said &quot;Trulia&quot; on the phone, and knew that didn&apos;t sound right.  The company I was thinking of was &quot;Topia.&quot;)

Ascendent ID
Avaunt
Avue Technologies
Continuant
IdentityMine
Multicare
Nu Element
Regence Blue Cross

Thank you,
