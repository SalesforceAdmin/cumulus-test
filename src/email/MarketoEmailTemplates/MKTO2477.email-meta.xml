Subject: Re: FW: Signature on MBO MSA Hi Nicolette! I hope you are doing great. After almost exactly one year it is now when I&apos;m ready to use the services of MBO! That may serve as a good insight for the company too :) When we connected last year I was just starting as an independent contractor and didn&apos;t have enough clarity yet about my SOW and income,  and neither enough business. I&apos;m currently working for an advertising agency, and with the blessing of the CEO, also managing a few clients on my own.  My total billings per month (outside my income from the ad agency) is $2,900 from three different clients. Could we work with that? Please let me know what do you need me to get them sign so you can take over? Thanks! Ivonne  ---------- Forwarded message ----------
