Would you join me at my next webinar &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/Oct29Webinar-SourcingTalent.html&gt; on October 29th at 1pm EST?   Itâ€™s called, &quot;Sourcing Talent for 2013 and Beyond: Whose Job is it, Anyway?&quot; and it&apos;s not about jobs or employees like you might expect. We&apos;re bringing in the experts to discuss how your business will compete in the next war for talent.
Two veteran Talent Acquisition Specialists will discuss how sourcing expert talent has changed over the years. MBO will also be sharing some of our recent research - and use it to support new techniques to attract, secure and engage this growing segment of talent. 
Even if you can&apos;t attend, if you register, we will send you copies of our research report and the recording of the webinar.
Register today! &lt;http://info.mbopartners.com/Oct29Webinar-SourcingTalent.html&gt;
