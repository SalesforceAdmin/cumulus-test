I still haven’t heard anything from BioSoteria so you may want to reach out to them to give them a nudge and I can follow up again next week.  I didn’t want to be too pushy since I have yet to “meet” them.  Let me know how you would like me to proceed.
 
Have a great weekend!
Nicolette

Hi Larry,
 
I am glad to hear you decided to move forward with MBO.  I will review the contract and send it over to my contracts team for their sign off and get it back to you by sometime Monday.  In the meantime, please feel free to introduce me to the clients and let them know I will be sending the contract back to them with any proposed changes and we can go from there.  If you have any additional questions please let me know.
 
We do provide Business Cards but not until you have been activate with us through your first few payrolls.  At that point, once you are sure you are going to continue your relationship with us then we can order them for you but they would be at your cost.  Let me know if you have questions about this as well.
 
Do not hesitate to reach out to me for any clarification and I look forward to working with you!
 
Have a great weekend,
Nicolette

Nicolette, I wanted to give you a heads up that I would like to move forward with MBO Partners as my employer of record. My first consulting agreement will be with BioSoteria and I have attached their standard consulting agreement template (I&apos;m not able to open it [maybe you can] so I&apos;m trying to get a version that I can). I am still considering what I want to ask for in terms of my billing rate, but wanted to get things moving with you.
 
Shall I put the appropriate individuals at BioSoteria in touch directly with you? Let me know next steps Nicolette and thanks again for all your help.  By the way, do you provide any assistance with business cards? Thanks.--Larry
 
 
Larry J. Davis, Pharm.D.
