Great!  We have worked with Northrop Grumman in the past so depending on the division you will be working with, we may or may not have to do a brand new contract.  If Matt reaches out to me we can discuss to determine if a new contract is needed.  I will wait until tomorrow to reach out to him to give him some time to follow up on your email but will put it on my calendar to reach out tomorrow.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
 
Thanks!
Nicolette
