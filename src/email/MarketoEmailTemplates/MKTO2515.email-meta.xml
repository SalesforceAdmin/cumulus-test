STEPPING OFF THE LADDER AND ONTO THE PLATFORM OF INDEPENDENCE
If you are a mid-career professional considering making the transition from traditional employment to independent work, you are not alone. Nearly 6 million Gen X professionals have made the leap to solo work. In fact, these mid-career professionals represent 35% of the total independent workforce.
