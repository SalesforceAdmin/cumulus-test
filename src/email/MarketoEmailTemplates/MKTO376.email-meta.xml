Soyung - It is so great to hear from you. Apologies for the late reply, I was out of the country. MBO Partners is a great resource if you&apos;re thinking about goign out on your own. While we don&apos;t faciliate jobs directly we are a big part of the picture for considering independence. I have a colleague who&apos;s an expert on this whole transition - perhaps I can connect you to him? We&apos;re also luanching a private tool for our associates that facilitates job tips between independents that may be really useful. I so understand your lifestage - and hope MBO can help. By way of this email, I&apos;m connecting you to Steve Aranchet - and if you ever want to catch up via phone to get tips - I&apos;d be happy to help. I can ask him to send you a LI request. Steve-by cc: FYI for Soyung&apos;s contact info.

Hi Aassia, 

How are you? Sounds like everything is going well. Just wondering about MBO. Do you facilitate contractors with part time jobs? I am curious as I would like to leave the corporate world to be able to spend time with my children, yet would enjoy keeping my foot in the door and not be a stay at home mom. I have heard that there are sites that work with moms in this specific arena, and wasn&apos;t sure if your firm is a possible venue for me. 

Cheers, 

Soyung
