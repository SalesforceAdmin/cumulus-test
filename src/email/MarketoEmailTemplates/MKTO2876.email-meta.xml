Please log in and complete the online enrollment as soon as possible (I just resent you the link to enroll). At the end, an I-9 will populate; you will sign/date section 1 and a local notary will sign/date section 2 ( there will be instructions on how to complete this form in your enrollment documents as well.) You can send this back to me via email (I don’t need a hard copy.)  I will also need you to send me a copy of your US passport (you can just take a picture with your phone and email that to me.) I also need you to log in to MBO Access &lt;https://access.mbopartners.com/&gt; and complete the “Industry Expertise” and “Disciplines” sections of your profile. This information needed for our workmen’s comp. policy and must be completed before I can activate your account and get you billing. Your user ID and password is the same as your MBO Business Center.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
