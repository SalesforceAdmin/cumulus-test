You can send this back to me via email (I dont need a hard copy.)  I will also need you to send me a copy of your US passport (you can just take a picture with your phone and email that to me.) I have attached an updated net cash showing 2k per day.  Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
Thanks!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.

Subject: RE: MBO Partners  Hi Mike, It was so nice speaking with you today. As we discussed Boradridge will reach out to Jeff to negotiate a daily rate and once that is confirmed Boradridge will reach out to MBO to finalize any needed paperwork.
