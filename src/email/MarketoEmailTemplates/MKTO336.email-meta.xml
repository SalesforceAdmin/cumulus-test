Steve, 
 
Thanks so much for your quick response! Sorry I didn&apos;t get off till 6:30 last night, I didn&apos;t want to call you back so late.
 
Just to give you a quick breakdown as to why I am contacting MBO:
 
I&apos;m very interested in becoming an independant consultant, and I&apos;ve been mulling it over for quite some time, however I&apos;m not familiar with the process. I work full time for Booz Allen, and I have strong ties within my firm and other firms as well. I&apos;ve supported large DoD clients my whole career.
 
So ultimately, my plan is to become an independant consultant and be brought back on by Booz as an external consultant. If you&apos;ve helped others in this process, any kind of guidance would be greatly appreciated!
 
Thanks so much,
James
