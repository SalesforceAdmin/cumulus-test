Attached please find the PO for this TASC project (I have blocked out Sunny’s information so you will see blank areas.) After a LOT of back and forth TASC let us know there are actually two separate projects they are bidding on for you and Sunny which is why we were getting asked for all the information twice. This PO represents the project they are ready to book you on now. Please take a look at it and confirm the rate. I am working on getting your account set up and once it is active  you will be notified via email.
Thanks Ken!Sara ___________________________________SARA CONDEConsultant Services Advisor MBO Partners t: 703.793.6028f: 703.793.6068e: sconde@mbopartners.comw: www.mbopartners.com Notice: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
