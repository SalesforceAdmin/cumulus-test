I got your message earlier, thank you for getting the I9 back to me so quickly.  Your portion of the enrollment is complete, we just now need to begin the process of putting a contract in place  with your clients.  Please let me know when you are ready to proceed with this portion of the process and we can go from there.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions for me and I look forward to hearing from you shortly.
 
Thank you,
