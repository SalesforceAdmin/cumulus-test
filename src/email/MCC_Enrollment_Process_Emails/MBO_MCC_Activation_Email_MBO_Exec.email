<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Hi&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Welcome to MBO Partners! I have just activated your account, so you’re ready to get started on your MCC assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Below is some important information you should know about working with MCC. Please keep this email handy so that you can refer back to it as needed.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Call Order</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">Please find attached the fully executed call order for your records. This serves as your authorization to begin the assignment through MBO.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Entering Your Time&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As you work, you are responsible for submitting your time (<a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf">instructions</a>) in accordance with your Statement of Work with MCC. <u>Be sure to submit your entries by close of business each Sunday for that week’s work</u>. Your COR (manager) will then approve your submissions.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><i><u>Important note</u>: While working for MCC from the U.S., you may claim no more than eight hours/day and five days/week. While working in the field, you may work no more than eight hours/day and six days/week.</i></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Entering Client-Billable Expenses</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">If you incur expenses that can be billed back to MCC, submit them through your MBO Business Center as well (<a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf">instructions</a>, pages 2 and 3). Please note that the <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MCC_CUSTOM_TRAVEL_REIMBURSEMENT_MAY_2013.pdf">MCC travel policy</a> applies for all expenses.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><i><u>Important notes on entering expenses</u></i>:</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">1.&nbsp;<b>Travel and Airfare</b>. For convenience, you may use our travel agent (<a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Ovation_Travel_Information.pdf">Ovation Travel Agency</a>) and MBO will purchase the ticket on your behalf. Be sure to take the document linked above with you when you travel, as there is an emergency after-hours line.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">a.&nbsp;If you use your own agent, remember that MCC’s <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MCC_CUSTOM_TRAVEL_REIMBURSEMENT_MAY_2013.pdf">travel policy</a> still applies.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">b.&nbsp;When traveling, also be sure to take the <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_DBA_Briefing_MCC.pdf">MBO Partners DBA policy</a> with you.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">2.&nbsp;<b>Non-Airfare Costs</b>. Pay for all other costs (hotel, meals, taxis, etc.) out-of-pocket and submit them for reimbursement.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">3.&nbsp;<b>Meals</b>. You are entitled to the daily GSA rate (<a href="http://www.gsa.gov/">www.gsa.gov</a>), with 75% first and last day of travel.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">4.&nbsp;<b>Hotels</b>. <i><u>Very important!</u></i> You are entitled to the actual hotel cost up to the per diem rate. When making hotel arrangements (whether through our agent or on your own), you are responsible for ensuring that the hotel is within the GSA rate (www.gsa.gov). If you cannot find a hotel within the rate, let me know and we will try to find alternatives or have the overage approved. This must be done in advance, not after the travel is made. If your hotel exceeds the GSA rate, you will only receive the GSA rate.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">5.</font>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: arial;"><b>Expense Submission</b>. Enter all expenses into your MBO Business Center and fax, upload, or scan/email receipts to us. We require receipts for all travel over $25 and for all other expenses (i.e., phone cards, immunizations, etc.).</span></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Entering Expenses that Are Not Billable to MCC</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As an MBO Exec Associate, you may submit out-of-pocket expenses (those not billable back to MCC) as you incur them. Once MBO approves an expense, we deduct it from your Gross Wages so you gain the associated tax benefit in the next paycheck, without waiting until tax time. (It’s the same tax impact as itemizing expenses on a Schedule C, only faster and easier.) Better still, you may be eligible to submit out-of-pocket medical and dependent care expenses the same way – which could mean even greater tax savings!</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Use your MBO Business Center to submit non-billable expenses and associated receipts. Please follow the links below to learn everything you need to know about MBO’s pre-tax expense policy and entry instructions.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;Instructions for <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf">entering expenses</a> (pages 2 and 3)</font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;List of allowable out-of-pocket <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Expense_List.pdf">business expenses</a></font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;List of allowable out-of-pocket <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Medical_Expense_Eligibility.pdf">medical expenses</a> (eligibility applies)</font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;List of allowable out-of-pocket <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Dependent_Care_Eligibility.pdf">dependent care expenses</a> (eligibility applies)</font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;Official MBO Partners <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Expense_Policy.pdf">Expense Policy</a></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Defense Base Act Insurance</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">For all overseas travel, you will be covered under MBO’s DBA (Defense Base Act insurance), which includes basic overseas Worker’s Comp and medical evacuation. This insurance does not cover emergency evacuation for country unrest, coups, etc. You may obtain additional insurance on your own or I can refer you to an outside agency. MCC typically does not cover the costs of additional insurances.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">MCC is covering the program fee for you. While MBO collects a program fee as you work (4.17% of your billings), MCC is increasing your negotiated bill rate to accommodate for the fee.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Payment Process and Timing</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As we discussed during our consultation call, MBO pays you after MCC pays us for your services. Due to MCC’s payment terms, you will typically receive your payment about 15 to 25 days after your manager approves your time for a given period. MBO always applies payments on Fridays. Remember, failure to submit time by the deadline above will result in payment delays.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Ongoing Support</b></font></div><div><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">I will be your primary support contact during your MCC engagement.
