<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Dear&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">My name is&nbsp;{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}, an Enrollment Manager here at MBO Partners. I&nbsp;understand that you are working with MBO’s Vendor Advisory Services Team to get set up as a vendor for your contract with Millennium Challenge Corp. In the meantime, I wanted to familiarize you with some important program characteristics and additional MCC requirements.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Get to Know Your Engagement Service</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">MCC has selected MBO Partners to be your engagement services provider. That means you will work “through” MBO as you complete your MCC assignment. If you meet the MCC requirements for a vendor relationship, you will engage through our <b>MBO Sub</b> subcontractor service. When you enroll in MBO Sub, we serve as your “agent-of-record” while you work and provide the support and white-glove service befitting a true independent professional.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Welcome_to_MBO_Sub.pdf">MBO Sub</a> makes it easy for self-employed professionals and their clients to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work. We bill MCC on your behalf, collect your billings, and deposit your funds into your private online Business Center.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">MCC is covering the program fee for you. While MBO collects a program fee as you work (4.17% of your billings if you qualify as a sub-contractor), MCC is increasing your negotiated bill rate to accommodate for the fee.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Payment Terms</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As per contractual payment terms, MCC pays MBO within 30 days of invoicing. However, MCC typically pays MBO sooner than required. As a result, MCC Associates typically their funds approximately 15 to 25 days after invoicing, after accommodating for payment processing.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>What Comes Next?</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">There are just a few more steps before you can begin your assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">1.&nbsp;<i>Documentation</i>. If you haven’t already, submit your supporting documents as instructed in the message from the MBO Vendor Advisory Services Team.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">2.&nbsp;<i>Enrollment</i>. After we determine your qualification status, you will receive another email from MBO with a link to our online enrollment system. If you qualify to engage as a vendor, the enrollment system will prompt you to sign a Contractor Agreement. (Here’s a sample <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Contractor_Agreement_MBO_Sub_Sample.pdf">Contractor Agreement</a>.)</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">3.&nbsp;<i>Begin!</i> Once you’ve enrolled, I’ll activate your MBO account and provide detailed instructions for entering your time and expenses.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">If you have any questions about these items, please contact me at the number below. If you have questions about the vendor qualification process, please address them with your Vendor Advisory Services Team representative.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Once again, we look forward to making your contract assignment with MCC a positive and enjoyable experience.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Sincerely,</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}</font></div><div><font face="arial">Enrollment Manager</font></div><div><font face="arial">MBO Partners</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div>]]></td>
