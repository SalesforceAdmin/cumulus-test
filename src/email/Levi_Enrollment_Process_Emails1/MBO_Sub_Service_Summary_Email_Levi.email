<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Dear&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">My name is&nbsp;{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}, an Enrollment Manager here at MBO Partners. I&nbsp;understand that you are working with MBO’s Vendor Advisory Services Team to get set up as a vendor for your contract with Levi. In the meantime, I wanted to familiarize you with some important program characteristics and additional Levi requirements.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Get to Know Your Engagement Service</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">Levi has selected MBO Partners to be your engagement services provider. That means you will work “through” MBO as you complete your Levi assignment. If you meet the Levi requirements for a vendor relationship, you will engage through our <b>MBO Sub</b> subcontractor service. When you enroll in MBO Sub, we serve as your “agent-of-record” while you work and provide the support and white-glove service befitting a true independent professional.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Welcome_to_MBO_Sub.pdf">MBO Sub</a> makes it easy for self-employed professionals and their clients to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work. We bill Levi on your behalf, collect your billings, and deposit your funds into your private online Business Center.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Background Screening</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">You will soon receive an email from Sterling Infosystems, Levi’s screening vendor, with instructions for completing a Levi-required background screening. (You may wish to add sterlinginfosystems.com to your email system’s safe senders list.) The screening’s cost, about $79, will be reflected in your MBO account after enrollment. Please complete the screening quickly so you can begin your project as soon as possible. &nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">Levi is covering the program fee for you. While MBO collects a program fee as you work (3.0% of your billings if you qualify as a sub-contractor), Levi is increasing your negotiated bill rate to accommodate for the fee.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Payment Terms</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As per contractual payment terms, Levi pays MBO within 30 days of invoicing. Based on these terms, and accommodating for payment processing, you will receive your funds approximately 35-40 days after invoicing. (Assumes Levi pays MBO within its payment terms.) For more information, please see the <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Levi_Detailed_Payment_Calendar.pdf">Levi Payment Timeline</a>.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>What Comes Next?</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">There are just a few more steps before you can begin your assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">1.&nbsp;<i>Documentation</i>.

After we determine your qualification status and you complete the screening requirement, you will receive another email from MBO that includes a link to our online enrollment system and some Levi-required on-boarding documents for you to review and complete. If you qualify to engage as a vendor, the enrollment system will prompt you to sign a Contractor Agreement. (Here’s a sample <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Contractor_Agreement_MBO_Sub_Sample.pdf">Contractor Agreement</a>.)</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">4.&nbsp;<i>Begin!</i> Once you’ve enrolled, I’ll activate your MBO account and provide detailed instructions for entering your time and expenses.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">If you have any questions about these items, please contact me at the number below.
