That means that you will work “through” MBO as you complete your SAE assignment. Based on our discussion, our <b>MBO Exec</b> service appears to be the most appropriate engagement alternative for you. When you enroll in MBO Exec, we engage you on a W-2 basis and provide the support and white-glove service befitting a true independent professional.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">MBO Exec makes it easy for self-employed professionals and their SAEs to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work. We handle everything else. We bill SAE on your behalf, collect your billings, withhold taxes, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">give access to group benefits,&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">Remove this clause if the enrollee is not eligible for benefits for any reason.</span></font><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;and reimburse your qualified business expenses.

(Assumes SAE pays MBO within its payment terms.)
