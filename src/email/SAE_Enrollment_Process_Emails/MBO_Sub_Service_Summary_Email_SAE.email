<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Dear&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">My name is&nbsp;{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}, an Enrollment Manager here at MBO Partners. I&nbsp;understand that you are working with MBO’s Vendor Advisory Services Team to get set up as a vendor for your contract with SAE International. In the meantime, I wanted to familiarize you with some important program characteristics and additional SAE requirements.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Get to Know Your Engagement Service</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">SAE has selected MBO Partners to be your engagement services provider. That means you will work “through” MBO as you complete your SAE assignment. If you meet the SAE requirements for a vendor relationship, you will engage through our <b>MBO Sub</b> subcontractor service. When you enroll in MBO Sub, we serve as your “agent-of-record” while you work and provide the support and white-glove service befitting a true independent professional.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Welcome_to_MBO_Sub.pdf">MBO Sub</a> makes it easy for self-employed professionals and their clients to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work. We bill SAE on your behalf, collect your billings, and deposit your funds into your private online Business Center.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">SAE is covering the program fee for you. While MBO collects a program fee as you work (2.5% of your billings if you qualify as a sub-contractor), SAE is increasing your negotiated bill rate to accommodate for the fee.</font></div><div><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">There is a program fee associated with your SAE engagement. For qualified sub-contractors, MBO will collect a program fee (2.5% of your billings) as you work.&nbsp;</font><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">Select the appropriate “Program Fee” paragraph based on whether the Referral Template or SOW indicates that SAE is covering the fee.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Payment Terms</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As per contractual payment terms, SAE processes MBO’s invoices semi-monthly then pays MBO within 15 days of invoicing. You will therefore receive your funds between 20 and 40 days after MBO invoices SAE, depending on the part of the semi-monthly invoicing cycle during which your work occurs and accommodating for payment processing. (Assumes SAE pays MBO within its payment terms.) Please see the <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_SAE_International_Payment_Timeline.pdf">SAE Payment Timeline</a> for a visual depiction of the payment process.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>What Comes Next?</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">There are just a few more steps before you can begin your assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">1.&nbsp;<i>Documentation</i>. If you haven’t already, submit your supporting documents as instructed in the message from the MBO Vendor Advisory Services Team.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">2.&nbsp;<i>Enrollment</i>. After we determine your qualification status, you will receive another email from MBO with a link to our online enrollment system. If you qualify to engage as a vendor, the enrollment system will prompt you to sign a Contractor Agreement. (Here’s a sample <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Contractor_Agreement_MBO_Sub_Sample.pdf">Contractor Agreement</a>.)</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">3.&nbsp;<i>Begin!</i> Once you’ve enrolled, I’ll activate your MBO account and provide detailed instructions for entering your time and expenses.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">If you have any questions about these items, please contact me at the number below. If you have questions about the vendor qualification process, please address them with your Vendor Advisory Services Team representative.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Once again, we look forward to making your contract assignment with SAE a positive and enjoyable experience.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Sincerely,</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}</font></div><div><font face="arial">Enrollment Manager</font></div><div><font face="arial">MBO Partners</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div>]]></td>
