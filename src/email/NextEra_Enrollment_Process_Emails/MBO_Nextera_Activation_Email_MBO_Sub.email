<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Hi&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Welcome to MBO Partners! I have just activated your account, so you’re ready to get started on your Nextera assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Below is some important information every MBO Associate working with Nextera should know. Please keep this email handy so that you can refer back to it as needed.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Entering Your Time and Client-Billable Expenses</b></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">As you work, you are responsible for entering your time and any billable expenses directly into the Fieldglass online system (<a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/NextEra_Time_and_Expense_Instructions.pdf">instructions</a>) <u><b>by close of business on Sunday each week for the previous week’s work</b></u>. &nbsp;Enter your time into Fieldglass, and once it’s approved, it will automatically import to MBO’s system each week. &nbsp;Enter any billable expenses into Fieldglass, and they will also import into MBO’s system each week. &nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Please note that you are responsible for completing any missing expense information and for submitting receipts for any billable expenses once they have imported into the MBO System. &nbsp;An expense can only be reimbursed to you once it has been approved in the MBO system. Follow the MBO <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf">expense</a> instructions for submitting either billable expenses that have imported from Fieldglass, or for non-billable expenses you would like to submit for a tax deduction.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">If you incur expenses that can be billed back to Nextera, submit them through your MBO Business Center as well (<a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf">instructions</a>, pages 2 and 3).&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">There is a program fee associated with your Nextera engagement. MBO will collect a program fee (4.6% of your billings) as you work.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Payment Process and Timing</b></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">As we discussed during our consultation call, MBO pays you after Nextera pays us for your services. Due to Nextera’s payment terms, you will typically receive your payment about 50 to 60 days after your manager approves your time for a given period. Remember, failure to submit time by the deadline above will result in payment delays.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Ongoing Support</b></font></div><div><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">I will be your primary support contact during your Nextera engagement.
