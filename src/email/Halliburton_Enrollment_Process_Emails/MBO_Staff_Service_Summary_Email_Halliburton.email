<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Hi&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">It was a pleasure speaking with you today about your upcoming assignment with Halliburton! As we discussed, Halliburton uses MBO Partners to provide engagement services for its contract workers. That means that you will work “through” MBO as you complete your Halliburton assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Below are the required next steps and a quick summary of what to expect when working through MBO.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Next Steps</b></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">1.&nbsp;<i>Enroll</i>. You will soon receive an email with a link to MBO’s enrollment system. While the online portion takes only a few minutes, the system also prompts you to print out an I-9 form which you must take to a Notary Public. (This is a Department of Homeland Security requirement.) You’re free to use any registered Notary, but please note that not all Notaries process I-9s. <a href="http://www.mbopartners.com/notaries">This list</a> or <a href="http://www.notaryrotary.com/">Notary Rotary</a> may be helpful in finding one who does, but we recommend that you call ahead to confirm before you go. <font color="#cc0000"><b>Remember to bring appropriate identification documents with you.</b></font></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">The Notary must verify your identity and simply sign the I-9 form – notarizing/stamping is not required. Be sure to complete the “Title” field with either “Notary” or “Authorized Representative” and <u>fax or scan/email the completed I-9 to me</u>. If you used a document from “List A” as your documentation, please send a copy of that to me as well.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">2.&nbsp;<i>Complete Drug and Background Screenings</i>. You will soon receive an email from Sterling Infosystems, Halliburton’s screening vendor, with instructions for completing Halliburton-required drug and background screenings. (You may wish to add sterlinginfosystems.com to your email system’s safe senders list.) <u>Be sure to begin the screening process quickly as the link will expire in a few days</u>.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Get to Know Your Engagement Service</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">You will engage through our “<b>MBO Staff</b>” payrolling service as you work on your Halliburton assignment. MBO Staff makes it easy for contract workers and their clients to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work, while MBO handles everything else. We bring you on as a W-2 employee (for the duration of your assignment), bill Halliburton on your behalf, collect your billings, withhold taxes, and provide your payments each week. We even cover you under our General and Professional Liability insurance at no cost to you.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">The MBO Staff service is provided to you free of charge. While MBO charges a program fee to Halliburton, this has no impact on your rate.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Payment Timing</b></font></div><div><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Once you begin your assignment, MBO direct-deposits your payments weekly (one week in arrears). Please note that your first payments may be via a paper check.</font></div><div><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Payment Timing</b></font></div><div><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Once you begin your assignment, MBO direct-deposits your payments weekly (two weeks in arrears).
