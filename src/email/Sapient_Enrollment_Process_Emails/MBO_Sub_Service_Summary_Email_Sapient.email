I&nbsp;understand that you are working with MBO’s Vendor Advisory Services Team to get set up as a vendor for your contract with Sapient. In the meantime, I wanted to familiarize you with some important program characteristics and additional Sapient requirements.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Get to Know Your Engagement Service</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">Sapient has selected MBO Partners to be your engagement services provider. That means you will work “through” MBO as you complete your Sapient assignment. If you meet the Sapient requirements for a vendor relationship, you will engage through our <b>MBO Sub</b> subcontractor service. When you enroll in MBO Sub, we serve as your “agent-of-record” while you work and provide the support and white-glove service befitting a true independent professional.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Welcome_to_MBO_Sub.pdf">MBO Sub</a> makes it easy for self-employed professionals and their clients to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work. We bill Sapient on your behalf, collect your billings, and deposit your funds into your private online Business Center.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">There is a program fee associated with your Sapient engagement.
