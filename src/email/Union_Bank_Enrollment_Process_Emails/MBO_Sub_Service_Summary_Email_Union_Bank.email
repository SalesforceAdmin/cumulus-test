<![CDATA[Hello {!Contact.FirstName},<br><br>My name is <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">EM_Fullname</span>, an Enrollment Manager here at MBO Partners. I understand that you are working with MBO’s Vendor Advisory Services Team to get set up as a vendor for your contract with Union Bank. In the meantime, I wanted to familiarize you with some additional Union Bank requirements and important program characteristics. <br><br><b>Get to Know Your Engagement Service</b><br>Union Bank has selected MBO Partners to be your engagement services provider. That means you will work “through” MBO as you complete your Union Bank assignment. If you meet the Union Bank requirements for a vendor relationship, you will engage through our MBO Sub subcontractor service. When you enroll in <b>MBO Sub</b>, we serve as your “agent-of-record” while you work and provide the support and white-glove service befitting a true independent professional. <br><br><a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Welcome_to_MBO_Sub.pdf">MBO Sub</a> makes it easy for self-employed professionals and their clients to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work. We bill Union Bank on your behalf, collect your billings, and deposit your funds into your private online Business Center. <br><br><b>Background Screening and Fingerprinting</b><br>You will soon receive an email from Accurate Background, Union Bank’s screening vendor, with instructions for completing required background screening and fingerprinting. (You may wish to add accuratebackground.com to your email system’s safe senders list.) The screenings’ cost, about $70, will be reflected in your MBO account after enrollment. Please complete the screening and fingerprinting quickly so you can begin your project as soon as possible. Please note that you must have your fingerprints taken at a certified fingerprinting location.<br><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><b>Program Fee </b><br>There is a program fee associated with your Union Bank engagement. For qualified sub-contractors, MBO will collect a program fee (2.5% of your billings) as you work.<span style="background-color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"> Use this paragraph for all MBO Subs that do not have a VMS fee. </span></span><br><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"><b>Program Fee </b><br>There is a program fee associated with your Union Bank engagement.

If you qualify to engage as a vendor, the enrollment system will prompt you to sign a Contractor Agreement. (Here’s a sample <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Contractor_Agreement_MBO_Sub_Sample.pdf">Contractor Agreement</a>.)<br><br>4. <i>Begin! </i>Once you’ve enrolled, I’ll activate your MBO account and provide detailed instructions for entering your time and expenses. <br><br><br>If you have any questions about these items, please contact me at the number below. If you have questions about the vendor qualification process, please address them with your Vendor Advisory Services Team representative.<br><br>Once again, we look forward to making your contract assignment with Union Bank a positive and enjoyable experience.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">EM_Fullname</span><br>Enrollment Manager<br>MBO Partners<br><br>]]></td>
