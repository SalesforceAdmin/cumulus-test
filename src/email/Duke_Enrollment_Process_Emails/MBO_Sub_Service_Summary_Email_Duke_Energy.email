<![CDATA[<font face="arial">Dear&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><div>My name is {!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}, an Enrollment Manager here at MBO Partners. I understand that you are working with MBO’s Vendor Advisory Services Team to get set up as a vendor for your contract with Duke Energy. In the meantime, I wanted to familiarize you with some important program characteristics and additional Duke Energy requirements.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Get to Know Your Engagement Service</b></div><div>Duke Energy has selected MBO Partners to be your engagement services provider. That means you will work “through” MBO as you complete your Duke Energy assignment. If you meet the Duke Energy requirements for a vendor relationship, you will engage through our MBO Sub subcontractor service. When you enroll in MBO Sub, we serve as your “agent-of-record” while you work and provide the support and white-glove service befitting a true independent professional.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Welcome_to_MBO_Sub.pdf">MBO Sub</a> makes it easy for self-employed professionals and their clients to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work. We bill Duke Energy on your behalf, collect your billings, and deposit your funds into your private online Business Center.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Background and Drug Screening</b></div><div>You will soon receive an email from Sterling Infosystems, Duke Energy’s screening vendor, with instructions for completing required background and drug screenings. (You may wish to add sterlinginfosystems.com to your email system’s safe senders list.) The screenings’ cost, approximately $195, will be reflected in your MBO account after enrollment. Please complete the screenings quickly so you can begin your project as soon as possible. &nbsp;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></div><div>Duke Energy is covering the program fee for you. While MBO collects a program fee as you work (2.5% of your billings if you qualify as a subcontractor), Duke Energy is increasing your negotiated bill rate to accommodate for the fee.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Payment Terms</b></div><div>As per contractual payment terms, Duke Energy pays MBO within 25 days of invoicing. Based on these terms, and accommodating for payment processing, you will receive your funds approximately 30 to 35 days after invoicing. (Assumes Duke Energy pays MBO within its payment terms.)</div><div><br></div><div><b>What Comes Next?</b></div><div>There are just a few more steps before you can begin your assignment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>1.&nbsp;<i>Documentation.</i> If you haven’t already, submit your supporting documents as instructed in the message from the MBO Vendor Advisory Services Team.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>2.&nbsp;<i>Screening.</i> As introduced above, please complete your screening requirements as soon as possible.</div><div><br></div><div>3.&nbsp;<i>Enrollment.</i> After we determine your qualification status and you complete the screening requirements, you will receive another email from MBO with a link to our online enrollment system. If you qualify to engage as a vendor, the enrollment system will prompt you to sign a Contractor Agreement. (Here’s a sample <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Contractor_Agreement_MBO_Sub_Sample.pdf">Contractor Agreement</a>.)</div><div><br></div><div>4.&nbsp;<i>Begin!</i> Once you’ve enrolled, I’ll activate your MBO account and provide detailed instructions for entering your time and expenses.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>If you have any questions about these items, please contact me at the number below. If you have questions about the vendor qualification process, please address them with your Vendor Advisory Services Team representative.</div><div><br></div><div>Once again, we look forward to making your contract assignment with Duke Energy a positive and enjoyable experience.</div><div><br></div><div>Sincerely,</div><div><br></div><div>{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}</div><div>Enrollment Manager</div><div>MBO Partners</div><div><br></div></font></div>]]></td>
