<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Hi&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Welcome to MBO Partners! I have just activated your account, so you’re ready to get started on your Bonneville Power Administration assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Below is some important information you should know about working with BPA. Please keep this email handy so that you can refer back to it as needed.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Entering Your Time and BPA-Billable Expenses</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As you work, you are responsible for time and expense entry in accordance with your Statement of Work with BPA. <u><b>Be sure to submit your entries by Sunday for the previous week’s work</b></u>. Please see these detailed <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/BPA_SLIM_Time_Instructions.pdf">time entry instructions</a>.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Entering Expenses that Are Billable to BPA</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">If you incur expenses that you can bill back to BPA, you must enter them in the Fieldglass system. Upon invoicing, you must also finalize them in your MBO Business Center. Please note that invoicing occurs bi-weekly, so you may have to wait as long as two weeks before your expenses will be available for finalization.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Please see the <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/BPA_SLIM_Expense_Instructions.pdf">Fieldglass expense entry instructions</a> and the MBO <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Finalizing_Expense_Submissions.pdf">instructions for finalizing expense entries</a>.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Entering Expenses that Are Not Billable to BPA</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As an MBO Exec Associate, you may submit out-of-pocket expenses (those not billable back to BPA) as you incur them. Once MBO approves an expense, we deduct it from your Gross Wages so you gain the associated tax benefit in the next paycheck, without waiting until tax time. (It’s the same tax impact as itemizing expenses on a Schedule C, only faster and easier.) Better still, you may be eligible to submit out-of-pocket medical and dependent care expenses the same way – which means even greater tax savings!</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Use your MBO Business Center to submit non-billable expenses and associated receipts. Please follow the links below to learn everything you need to know about MBO’s pre-tax expense policy and entry instructions.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;List of allowable out-of-pocket <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Expense_List.pdf">business expenses</a></font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;List of allowable out-of-pocket <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Medical_Expense_Eligibility.pdf">medical expenses</a> (eligibility applies)</font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;List of allowable out-of-pocket <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Dependent_Care_Eligibility.pdf">dependent care expenses</a> (eligibility applies)</font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;Official MBO Partners <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Expense_Policy.pdf">Expense Policy</a></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><br></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">There is a program fee associated with your BPA engagement. MBO collects a program fee (5.07% of your billings) as you work. This includes the MBO fee and the fee associated with using BPA’s Vendor Management System, SLIM.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Payment Process and Timing</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As we discussed during our consultation call, BPA pays MBO within 10 days of invoicing (which occurs bi-weekly). Based on these terms, and accommodating for payment processing, you will receive your funds approximately 20 days after invoicing. (Assumes BPA pays MBO within its payment terms.) Remember, failure to submit time by the deadline above will result in payment delays.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Ongoing Support</b></font></div><div><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">I will be your primary support contact during your BPA engagement.
