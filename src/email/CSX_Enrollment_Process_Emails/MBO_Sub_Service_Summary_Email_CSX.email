<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Dear&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">My name is&nbsp;{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}, an Enrollment Manager here at MBO Partners. I&nbsp;understand that you are working with MBO’s Vendor Advisory Services Team to get set up as a vendor for your contract with CSX. In the meantime, I wanted to familiarize you with some important program characteristics and additional CSX requirements.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Get to Know Your Engagement Service</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">CSX has selected MBO Partners to be your engagement services provider. That means you will work “through” MBO as you complete your CSX assignment. If you meet the CSX requirements for a vendor relationship, you will engage through our <b>MBO Sub</b> subcontractor service. When you enroll in MBO Sub, we serve as your “agent-of-record” while you work and provide the support and white-glove service befitting a true independent professional.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Welcome_to_MBO_Sub.pdf">MBO Sub</a> makes it easy for self-employed professionals and their clients to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work. We bill CSX on your behalf, collect your billings, and deposit your funds into your private online Business Center.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Background and Drug Screening</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">You will soon receive an email from Sterling Infosystems, CSX’s screening vendor, with instructions for completing the required background and drug screenings. (You may wish to add sterlinginfosystems.com to your email system’s safe senders list.) The screenings’ cost, typically about $100, will be reflected in your MBO account after enrollment. Please complete the screenings quickly so you can begin your project as soon as possible.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">CSX is covering the program fee for you. While MBO collects a program fee as you work (4.0% of your billings if you qualify as a subcontractor), CSX is increasing your negotiated bill rate to accommodate for the fee.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Payment Terms</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">You will receive payment for your services within about 10 to 15 days from when your manager approves your time submission. Expense reimbursements typically take longer.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>What Comes Next?</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">There are just a few more steps before you can begin your assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">1.&nbsp;<i>Documentation</i>. If you haven’t already, submit your supporting documents as instructed in the message from the MBO Vendor Advisory Services Team.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">2.&nbsp;<i>Screening</i>. As introduced above, please complete your screening requirements as soon as possible.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">3.&nbsp;<i>Enrollment</i>. After we determine your qualification status and you complete the screening requirements, you will receive another email from MBO with a link to our online enrollment system. If you qualify to engage as a vendor, the enrollment system will prompt you to sign a Contractor Agreement. (Here’s a sample <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Contractor_Agreement_MBO_Sub_Sample.pdf">Contractor Agreement</a>.)</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">4.&nbsp;<i>Begin!</i> Once you’ve enrolled, I’ll activate your MBO account and provide detailed instructions for entering your time and expenses.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">If you have any questions about these items, please contact me at the number below. If you have questions about the vendor qualification process, please address them with your Vendor Advisory Services Team representative.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Once again, we look forward to making your contract assignment with CSX a positive and enjoyable experience.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Sincerely,</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}</font></div><div><font face="arial">Enrollment Manager</font></div><div><font face="arial">MBO Partners</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div>]]></td>
