<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Dear&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">My name is&nbsp;{!Lead.Enrollment_Manager__c}, an Enrollment Manager here at MBO Partners. I&nbsp;understand that you are working with MBO’s Vendor Advisory Services Team to get set up as a vendor for your contract with Best Buy. In the meantime, I wanted to familiarize you with some important program characteristics and additional Best Buy requirements.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Get to Know Your Engagement Service</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">Best Buy has selected MBO Partners to be your engagement services provider. That means you will work “through” MBO as you complete your Best Buy assignment. If you meet the Best Buy requirements for a vendor relationship, you will engage through our <b>MBO Sub</b> subcontractor service. When you enroll in MBO Sub, we serve as your “agent-of-record” while you work and provide the support and white-glove service befitting a true independent professional.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/Welcome_to_MBO_Sub.pdf">MBO Sub</a> makes it easy for self-employed professionals and their clients to work together. You simply submit your time and expenses as you work. We bill Best Buy on your behalf, collect your billings, and deposit your funds into your private online Business Center.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Background and Drug Screening</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">You will soon receive an email from Sterling Infosystems, Best Buy’s screening vendor, with instructions for completing Best Buy-required background and drug screenings.

Please complete the screenings quickly so you can begin your project as soon as possible.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">There is a program fee associated with your Best Buy engagement. For qualified sub-contractors, MBO will collect a program fee (4.55% of your billings) as you work.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Payment Terms</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As per contractual payment terms, Best Buy pays MBO within 50 days of invoicing. Based on these terms, and accommodating for payment processing, you will receive your funds approximately 55 to 65 days after invoicing. (Assumes Best Buy pays MBO within its payment terms.)</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>What Comes Next?</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">There are just a few more steps before you can begin your assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">1.&nbsp;<i>Documentation</i>.
