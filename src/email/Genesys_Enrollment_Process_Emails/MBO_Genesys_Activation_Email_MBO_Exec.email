<![CDATA[<div><font face="arial">Hi&nbsp;{!Lead.FirstName},</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Welcome to MBO Partners! I have just activated your account, so you’re ready to get started on your Genesys assignment.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Below is some important information you should know about working with Genesys. Please keep this email handy so that you can refer back to it as needed.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Entering Your Time and Client-Billable Expenses</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As you work, you are responsible for time, milestone, and expense entry (<a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf">instructions</a>) in accordance with your Statement of Work with Genesys. <u><b>Be sure to submit your entries by close of business each <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Friday</span> for that week’s work</b></u>.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">If you incur expenses that can be billed back to Genesys, submit them through your MBO Business Center as well (<a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf">instructions</a>, pages 2 and 3).&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Entering Expenses that Are Not Billable to Genesys</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As an MBO Exec Associate, you may submit out-of-pocket expenses (those not billable back to Genesys) as you incur them. Once MBO approves an expense, we deduct it from your Gross Wages so you gain the associated tax benefit in the next paycheck, without waiting until tax time. (It’s the same tax impact as itemizing expenses on a Schedule C, only faster and easier.) Better still, you may be eligible to submit out-of-pocket medical and dependent care expenses the same way – which could mean even greater tax savings!</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Use your MBO Business Center to submit non-billable expenses and associated receipts. Please follow the links below to learn everything you need to know about MBO’s pre-tax expense policy and entry instructions.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;Instructions for <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Exec_Time_and_Expense_Entry_Instructions.pdf">entering expenses</a> (pages 2 and 3)</font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;List of allowable out-of-pocket <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Expense_List.pdf">business expenses</a></font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;List of allowable out-of-pocket <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Medical_Expense_Eligibility_2011.pdf">medical expenses</a> (eligibility applies)</font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;List of allowable out-of-pocket <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Dependent_Care_Eligibility.pdf">dependent care expenses</a> (eligibility applies)</font></div><div><font face="arial">•&nbsp;Official MBO Partners <a href="http://info.mbopartners.com/rs/mbo/images/MBO_Partners_Expense_Policy.pdf">Expense Policy</a></font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Program Fee&nbsp;</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">Genesys is covering the program fee for you. While MBO collects a program fee as you work (5.0% of your billings), Genesys is increasing your negotiated bill rate to accommodate for the fee.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b>Payment Process and Timing</b></font></div><div><font face="arial">As we discussed during our consultation call, MBO pays you after Genesys pays us for your services. Due to Genesys’ payment terms, you will typically receive your payment about 52 days after your manager approves your time for a given period. Remember, failure to submit time by the deadline above will result in payment delays.</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial"><b style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Ongoing Support</b></font></div><div><font face="arial" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">I will be your primary support contact during your Genesys engagement.
