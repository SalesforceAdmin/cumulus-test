Once MBO approves an expense, we deduct it from your Gross Wages so you gain the associated tax benefit in the next paycheck, without waiting until tax time. (It’s the same tax impact as itemizing expenses on a Schedule C, only faster and easier.) &nbsp;Better still, you may be eligible to submit out-of-pocket medical and dependent care expenses the same way – which could mean even greater tax savings!</font></div><div><font face="arial"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial">Use your MBO Business Center to submit non-billable expenses and associated receipts.
